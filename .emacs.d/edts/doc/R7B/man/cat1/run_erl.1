EXPORTS
     run_erl pipe_dir/ log_dir "exec command [command_arguments]"

          The _r_u_n__e_r_l program arguments are:

            pipe_dir:
                This is where to  put  the  named  pipe,  usually
                /_t_m_p/.

            log_dir:
                This is where the log files  are  written.  There
                will  be  one log file, _r_u_n__e_r_l._l_o_g that log pro-
                gress  and  warnings  from  the  _r_u_n__e_r_l  program
                itself  and there will be up to five log files at
                maximum 100KB each with the content of the  stan-
                dard  streams  from  and to the command. When the
                logs are full _r_u_n__e_r_l will delete and  reuse  the
                oldest log file.

            "exec command [command_arguments]":
                In the third argument _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is the  to  execute
                where  everything  written to stdin and stdout is
                logged to _l_o_g__d_i_r.
