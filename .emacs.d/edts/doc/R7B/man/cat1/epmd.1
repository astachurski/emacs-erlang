NAME
     epmd - Erlang Port Mapper Daemon

DESCRIPTION
     This daemon acts as a name server on all hosts  involved  in
     distributed Erlang computations. When an Erlang node starts,
     the node has a name and it obtains an address from the  host
     OS  kernel.  The  name  and the address are sent to the _e_p_m_d
     daemon running on the local host. In a  TCP/IP  environment,
     the  address  consists  of the IP address and a port number.
     The name of the node is an atom on the  form  of  _N_a_m_e@_N_o_d_e.
     The  job  of  the _e_p_m_d daemon is to keep track of which node
     name listens on which address. Hence, _e_p_m_d map symbolic node
     names to machine addresses.

     The daemon is started automatically by the  Erlang  start-up
     script.

     The program _e_p_m_d can also be used for  a  variety  of  other
     purposes,  for example checking the DNS (Domain Name System)
     configuration of a host.


EXPORTS
     epmd [-daemon]

          Starts a name server as a daemon. If it  has  no  argu-
          ment,  the  _e_p_m_d runs as a normal program with the con-
          trolling terminal of the shell in which it is  started.
          Normally, it should run as a daemon.

     epmd -names

          Requests the names of the local Erlang nodes  _e_p_m_d  has
          registered.

     epmd -kill

          Kills the _e_p_m_d process.

     epmd -help

          Write short info about the usage including some  debug-
          ging options not listed here.

Logging
     On some operating systems _s_y_s_l_o_g  will  be  used  for  error
     reporting  when  epmd runs as an daemon. To enable the error
     logging you have to edit /etc/syslog.conf() file and add  an
     entry
