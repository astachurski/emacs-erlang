NAME
     werl - The Erlang Emulator

DESCRIPTION
     On Windows 95/NT, the preferred way to start the Erlang sys-
     tem is:

     _w_e_r_l <_s_c_r_i_p_t-_f_l_a_g_s> <_u_s_e_r-_f_l_a_g_s>

     This will start Erlang in its own window, which is nice  for
     interactive  use  (command-line  editing will work and there
     are scrollbars). All flags except the -_o_l_d_s_h_e_l_l flag work as
     in _e_r_l.

     In cases there you want to redirect  standard  input  and/or
     standard output or use Erlang in a pipeline, the _w_e_r_l is not
     suitable, and the _e_r_l program should be used instead.
