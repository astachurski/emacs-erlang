NAME
     start_erl - Start Erlang for  embedded  systems  on  Windows
     NT(R)

DESCRIPTION
     This describes the _s_t_a_r_t__e_r_l program specific to Windows NT.
     Although  there  exists programs with the same name on other
     platforms, their functionality is not the same.

     The _s_t_a_r_t__e_r_l program is distributed both in  compiled  form
     (under  <Erlang root>\erts-<version>\bin) and in source form
     (under <Erlang root>\erts-<version>\src). The purpose of the
     source  code  is to make it possible to easily customize the
     program for local needs, such as  cyclic  restart  detection
     etc. There is also a "make"-file, written for the _n_m_a_k_e pro-
     gram distributed with Microsoft(R) Visual C++(R).  The  pro-
     gram can however be compiled with any Win32 C compiler (pos-
     sibly with slight modifications).

     The purpose of the program is to  aid  release  handling  on
     Windows  NT(R).  The  program should be called by the _e_r_l_s_r_v
     program, read up the release data  file  start_erl.data  and
     start  Erlang.  Certain  options  to start_erl are added and
     removed by the release handler during upgrade with  emulator
     restart (more specifically the -_d_a_t_a option).


EXPORTS
     start_erl [<erl options>] ++ [<start_erl options>]

          The _s_t_a_r_t__e_r_l program in it's original form  recognizes
          the following options:

            ++: Mandatory, delimits start_erl options from normal
                Erlang  options.  Everything  on the command line
                _b_e_f_o_r_e the ++ is interpreted  as  options  to  be
                sent  to  the _e_r_l program. Everything _a_f_t_e_r ++ is
                interpreted as options to _s_t_a_r_t__e_r_l itself.

            -reldir <release root>:
                Mandatory if the environment variable  _R_E_L_D_I_R  is
                not  specified. Tells start_erl where the root of
                the release tree is  placed  in  the  file-system
                (like <Erlang root>\releases). The _s_t_a_r_t__e_r_l._d_a_t_a
                file is expected to be placed in  this  directory
                (if not otherwise specified).

            -data <data file name>:
                Optional,  specifies  another  data   file   than
                start_erl.data  in  the  <release  root>.  It  is
                specified relative to the <release root> or abso-
                lute  (includeing drive letter etc.). This option

                is used by the release handler during upgrade and
                should  not  be used during normal operation. The
                release data file should not  normally  be  named
                differently.

            -bootflags <boot flags file name>:
                Optional,  specifies  a  file  name  relative  to
                actual  release  directory (that is the subdirec-
                tory of <release root> where the ._b_o_o_t file  etc.
                are   placed).  The  contents  of  this  file  is
                appended to  the  command  line  when  Erlang  is
                started. This makes it easy to start the emulator
                with different options for different releases.

NOTES
     As the source code is distributed, it can easily be modified
     to  accept  other options. The program must still accept the
     -_d_a_t_a option with the  semantics  described  above  for  the
     release handler to work correctly.

     The Erlang emulator is found by examining the registry  keys
     for the emulator version specified in the release data file.
     The new emulator needs to be properly installed  before  the
     upgrade for this to work.

     Although the program is located together with files specific
     to  emulator  version,  it is not expected to be specific to
     the emulator version. The release handler  does  _n_o_t  change
     the -_m_a_c_h_i_n_e option to _e_r_l_s_r_v during emulator restart. Place
     the (possibly customized) _s_t_a_r_t__e_r_l program so  that  it  is
     not overwritten during upgrade.

     The _e_r_l_s_r_v program's default options are not sufficient  for
     release handling. The machine _e_r_l_s_r_v starts should be speci-
     fied as the _s_t_a_r_t__e_r_l program and the arguments should  con-
     tain the ++ followed by desired options.
