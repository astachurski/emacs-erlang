NAME
     appup - Application upgrade file

DESCRIPTION
     The _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _u_p_g_r_a_d_e _f_i_l_e defines how an  application  is
     upgraded in a running system.

     This file is used by _s_y_s_t_o_o_l_s to  generate  release  upgrade
     files.


FILE SYNTAX
     Applications can be upgraded and the instructions to do this
     are placed in the ._a_p_p_u_p file for the application. For exam-
     ple, for the _s_n_m_p application these instructions are  placed
     in the _s_n_m_p._a_p_p_u_p file. The ._a_p_p_u_p file looks as follows:

     The application upgrade file is called _N_a_m_e._a_p_p_u_p where _N_a_m_e
     is  the  name of the application. The file should be located
     in the _e_b_i_n directory for the application.

     The ._a_p_p_u_p file  contains  one  single  Erlang  term,  which
     defines  the  instructions  used to upgrade the application.
     The file has the following syntax:

     {Vsn,
         [{UpFromVsn, UpFromScript}, ...],
         [{DownToVsn, DownToScript}, ...]}.

       * _V_s_n = _s_t_r_i_n_g() is the current version  of  the  applica-
         tion.

       * _U_p_F_r_o_m_V_s_n = _s_t_r_i_n_g() is a version we can upgrade from.

       * _U_p_F_r_o_m_S_c_r_i_p_t is the script which describes the  sequence
         of  release  upgrade  instructions. Refer to the section
         Release Handling Instructions in the SASL  User's  Guide
         for a description of this script.

       * _D_o_w_n_T_o_V_s_n = _s_t_r_i_n_g() is a version to which we can  down-
         grade.

       * _D_o_w_n_T_o_S_c_r_i_p_t is the script which describes the  sequence
         of  downgrade instructions. Refer to the section Release
         Handling Instructions in the SASL  User's  Guide  for  a
         description of this script.

     In the case of _U_p_F_r_o_m_S_c_r_i_p_t and _D_o_w_n_F_r_o_m_S_c_r_i_p_t, the  scripts
     typically  contain  one line for each module in the applica-
     tion.
