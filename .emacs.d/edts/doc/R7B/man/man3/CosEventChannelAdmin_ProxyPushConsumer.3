.SH MODULE
CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPushConsumer \-  This module implements a ProxyPushConsumer interface which acts as a middleman between push supplier and the event channel\&. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The ProxyPushConsumer interface defines the second step for connecting push suppliers to the event channel\&. A proxy consumer is similar to a normal consumer, but includes an additional method for connecting a supplier to the proxy consumer\&. 
.LP
There are a number of exceptions that can be returned from functions in this interface\&. 
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
AlreadyConnected is defined as \fI-record(\&'AlreadyConnected\&', {})\&.\fR
.TP 2
*
Disconnected is defined as \fI-record(\&'Disconnected\&', {})\&.\fR
.RE
.LP
These exceptions are defined in the file \fIevent_service\&.hrl\fR\&. 
.LP
Any object that possesses an object reference that supports the ProxyPushConsumer interface can perform the following operations: 

.SH EXPORTS
.LP

connect_push_supplier(Object, PushSupplier) -> Return

Object = #objref

PushSupplier = #objref of PushSupplier type
.br
Return = void

.RE
.RS
.LP
This operation connects PushSupplier object to the ProxyPushConsumer object\&. A nil object reference can be passed to this operation\&. If so a channel cannot invoke the disconnect_push_supplier operation on the supplier; the supplier may be disconnected from the channel without being informed\&. If the ProxyPushConsumer is already connected to a PushSupplier, then the \fIAlreadyConnected exception\fR is raised\&.

.LP
This operation disconnects proxy push consumer from the event channel\&. Sends a notification about the loss of the connection to the push supplier attached to it, unless nil object reference was passed at the connection time\&.

push(Object, Data) -> Return

.LP
This operation sends event data to all connected consumers via the event channel\&. If the event communication has already been disconnected, the \fIDisconnected\fR is raised\&.
