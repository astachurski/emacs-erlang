dbg \- The Text Based Trace Facility 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module implements a text based interface to the \fItrace/3\fR and the trace_pattern/2 BIF\&'s\&. It makes it possible to trace functions, processes, and messages on text based terminals\&. It can be used instead of, or as complement to, the \fIpman\fR module\&. 
.LP
The utilities are suitable to use in system testing on large systems, where other tools have too much impact on the system performance\&. Some primitive support for sequential tracing is also included, see the advanced topics section\&.

If the \fIItem\fR is a pid(), the corresponding process is traced\&. If no trace port is used, the process may be a remote process (on another Erlang node)\&. The node must be on the list of traced nodes (see \fIn/1\fR)\&.

If the \fIItem\fR is an atom other than \fIall\fR, \fInew\fR or \fIexisting\fR, the process with the corresponding registered name is traced\&.

The function returns either an error tuple or a tuple \fI{ok, List}\fR\&. The \fIList\fR consists of specifications of how many processes that matched (in the case of a pure pid() exactly 1)\&. The specification of matched processes can be either \fI{matched, N}\fR, when only local processes matched, or \fI{matched, Node, N}\fR in the case of tracing a remote node (as well as the local)\&. If the remote processor call,\fIrpc\fR, to a remote node fails, the \fIrpc\fR error message is delivered as a fourth argument and the number of matched processes are 0\&. Note that the result {ok, List} may contain a list where \fIrpc\fR calls to one or more nodes failed\&. The \fIok\fR only means that some processes matched and are traced\&.

This function enables call trace for one or more functions\&. All exported functions matching the \fI{Module, Function, Arity}\fR argument will be concerned, but the \fImatch_spec()\fR may further narrow down the set of function calls generating trace messages\&. 
.LP
For a description of the \fImatch_spec()\fR syntax, please turn to the \fI User\&'s guide\fR part of the online documentation for the runtime system (\fIerts\fR)\&. The chapter \fIMatch Specification in Erlang\fR explains the general match specification "language"\&. 
.LP
The Module, Function and/or Arity parts of the tuple may be specified as the atom \fI\&'_\&'\fR which is a "wild-card" matching all modules/functions/arities\&. Note, if the Module is specified as \fI\&'_\&'\fR, the Function and Arity parts have to be specified as \&'_\&' too\&. The same holds for the Functions relation to the Arity\&. 
.LP
All nodes added with \fIn/1\fR will be affected by this call, and if Module is not \fI\&'_\&'\fR the module will be loaded on all nodes\&. 
.LP
The function returns either an error tuple or a tuple \fI{ok, List}\fR\&. The \fIList\fR consists of specifications of how many functions that matched, in the same way as the processes are presented in the return value of \fIp/2\fR\&. 
.LP
There may be a tuple \fI{saved, N}\fR in the return value, if the MatchSpec is other than []\&. The integer \fIN\fR may then be used in subsequent calls to this function and will stand as an "alias" for the given expression (see also ltp/0 below)\&. 
.LP
If an error is returned, it can be due to errors in compilation of the match specification\&. Such errors are presented as a list of tuples \fI{error, string()}\fR where the string is a textual explanation of the compilation error\&. An example:

.nf
(x@y)4> dbg:tp({dbg,ltp,0},[{[],[],[{message, two, arguments}, {noexist}]}])\&.
{error,
 [{error,"Special form \&'message\&' called with wrong number of

This function starts a tracer server with additional parameters\&. The first parameter, the \fIType\fR, indicates if trace messages should be handled by a receiving process (\fIprocess\fR) or by a tracer port (\fIport\fR)\&. For a description about tracer ports see \fItrace_port/2\fR\&. 
.LP
If \fIType\fR is a process, a message handler function can be specified (\fIHandlerSpec\fR)\&. The handler function, which should be a \fIfun\fR taking two arguments, will be called for each trace message, with the first argument containing the message as it is and the second argument containing the return value from the last invocation of the fun\&. The initial value of the second parameter is specified in the \fIInitialData\fR part of the \fIHandlerSpec\fR\&. The \fIHandlerFun\fR may chose any appropriate action to take when invoked, and can save a state for the next invocation by returning it\&. 
.LP
If \fIType\fR is a port, then the second parameter should be a \fIfun\fR which takes no arguments and returns a newly opened trace port when called\&. Such a \fIfun\fR is preferably generated by calling \fItrace_port/2\fR\&. 
.LP
Note that most \fIdbg\fR functions start the server automatically\&. Call this function with the appropriate arguments \fIbefore\fR calling any other functions in the module\&. The server can be stopped with a call to \fIstop/0\fR if it has been started in the default form by mistake\&.

If an error is returned, it can either be due to a tracer server already running (\fI{error, already_started}\fR) or due to the \fIHandlerFun\fR throwing an exception\&.

This function creates a trace port generating \fIfun\fR\&. The \fIfun\fR takes no arguments and returns a newly opened trace port\&. The return value from this function is suitable as a second parameter to tracer/2, i\&. e\&. \fIdbg:tracer(port, dbg:trace_port(ip, 4711))\fR\&. 
.LP
A trace port is an Erlang port to a dynamically linked in driver that handles trace messages directly, without the overhead of sending them as messages in the Erlang virtual machine\&.
.LP
Two trace drivers are currently implemented, the \fIfile\fR and the \fIip\fR trace drivers\&. The file driver sends all trace messages into a binary file, from where they later can be fetched and processed with the \fItrace_client/2\fR function\&. The ip driver opens a TCP/IP port where it listens for connections\&. When a client (preferably started by calling \fItrace_client/2\fR on another Erlang node) connects, all trace messages are sent over the IP network for further processing by the remote client\&. 
.LP
Using a trace port significantly lowers the overhead imposed by using tracing\&.
.LP
The file trace driver expects a filename in the native machine format as parameter\&. The file is written with a high degree of buffering, why all trace messages are \fInot\fR guaranteed to be saved in the file in case of a system crash\&. That is the price to pay for low tracing overhead\&. 
.LP
The ip trace driver has a queue of \fIQueSize\fR messages waiting to be delivered\&. If the driver cannot deliver messages as fast as they are produced by the runtime system, a special message is sent, which indicates how many messages that are dropped\&. That message will arrive at the handler function specified in \fItrace_client/3\fR as the tuple \fI{drop, N}\fR where \fIN\fR is the number of consecutive messages dropped\&. In case of heavy tracing, drop\&'s are likely to occur, and they surely occur if no client is reading the trace messages\&.

Note that processes on other nodes cannot be traced using a trace port\&.

This function starts a trace client that reads the output created by a trace port driver and handles it in mostly the same way as a tracer process created by the \fItracer/0\fR function\&. 
.LP
If \fIType\fR is \fIfile\fR, the client reads all trace messages stored in the file named \fIFilename\fR (the second argument) and let\&'s the default handler function format the messages on the console\&. This is one way to interpret the data stored in a file by the file trace port driver\&. 
.LP
If \fIType\fR is \fIfollow_file\fR, the client behaves as in the \fIfile\fR case, but keeps trying to read (and process) more data from the file until stopped by \fIstop_trace_client/1\fR\&. 
.LP
If \fIType\fR is \fIip\fR, the client connects to the TCP/IP port \fIPortNumber\fR on the host \fIHostname\fR, from where it reads trace messages until the TCP/IP connection is closed\&. If no \fIHostname\fR is specified, the local host is assumed\&. 
.LP
As an example, one can let trace messages be sent over the network to another Erlang node (preferably \fInot\fR distributed), where the formatting occurs: 
.LP
On the node \fIstack\fR there\&'s an Erlang node \fIant@stack\fR, in the shell, type the following: 

.nf

          ant@stack> dbg:p(self(), send)\&.
          {ok, 1}
.fi
.LP
All trace messages are now sent to the trace port driver, which in turn listens for connections on the TCP/IP port 4711\&. If we want to see the messages on another node, preferably on another host, we do like this: 

.nf
          -> dbg:trace_client(ip, {"stack", 4711})\&.
          <0\&.42\&.0>
.fi
.LP
If we now send a message from the shell on the node \fIant@stack\fR, where all sends from the shell are traced: 

.nf
          ant@stack> self() ! hello\&.
          hello
.fi
.LP
The following will appear at the console on the node that started the trace client: 

.nf
          (<0\&.23\&.0>) <0\&.23\&.0> ! hello
          (<0\&.23\&.0>) <0\&.22\&.0> ! {shell_rep,<0\&.23\&.0>,{value,hello,[],[]}}
.fi

.SH Advanced topics - combining with seq_trace
.LP
The \fIdbg\fR module is primarily targeted towards tracing through the \fIerlang:trace/3\fR function\&. It is sometimes desired to trace messages in a more delicate way, which can be done with the help of the \fIseq_trace\fR module\&. 
.LP
Seq_trace implements sequential tracing (known in the AXE10 world, and sometimes called "forlopp tracing")\&. \fIdbg\fR can interpret messages generated from \fIseq_trace\fR and the same tracer function for both types of tracing can be used\&. The \fIseq_trace\fR messages can even be sent to a trace port for further analysis\&. 
.LP
As a match specification can turn on sequential tracing, the combination of \fIdbg\fR and \fIseq_trace\fR can be quite powerful\&. This brief example shows a session where sequential tracing is used:

.nf
1> dbg:tracer()\&.
{ok,<0\&.30\&.0>}
2> {ok, Tracer} = dbg:get_tracer()\&.
{ok,<0\&.31\&.0>}
3> seq_trace:set_system_tracer(Tracer)\&.
false
4> dbg:tp(dbg, get_tracer, [{[],[],[{set_seq_token, send, true}]}])\&.  
{ok,[{matched,1},{saved,1}]}
5> dbg:p(all,call)\&.
{ok,[{matched,22}]}
6> dbg:get_tracer(), receive after 1 -> ok end\&.
(<0\&.25\&.0>) call dbg:get_tracer()
SeqTrace [0]: (<0\&.25\&.0>) <0\&.30\&.0> ! {<0\&.25\&.0>,get_tracer} [Serial: {2,4}]
SeqTrace [0]: (<0\&.30\&.0>) <0\&.25\&.0> ! {dbg,{ok,<0\&.31\&.0>}} [Serial: {4,5}]
ok
.fi
.LP
This session sets the system_tracer to the same process as the ordinary tracer process (i\&. e\&. <0\&.31\&.0>) and sets the trace pattern for the function \fIdbg:get_tracer\fR to one that has the action of setting a sequential token\&. When the function is called by a traced process (all processes are traced in this case), the process gets "contaminated" by the token and \fIseq_trace\fR messages are sent both for the server request and the response\&. The \fIreceive after 1 -> ok end\fR after the call clears the \fIseq_trace\fR token, why no messages are sent when the answer propagates via the shell to the console port\&. The output would otherwise have been more noisy\&.
