.TH heart 3 "kernel  2.6.1" "Ericsson Utvecklings AB" "ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION"
.SH MODULE
heart \- Heartbeat Monitoring of an Erlang Runtime System\&.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIheart\fR module sends periodic heartbeats to an external port program, which is also named heart\&. The purpose of the heart port program is to check that the Erlang runtime system it is supervising is still running\&. If the port program has not received any heartbeats within \fIHEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT\fR (default is 60 seconds) from the last one, the system can be rebooted\&. Also, if the system is equipped with a hardware watchdog timer and is running Solaris, the watchdog can be used to supervise the entire system\&. 
.LP
This module is started by the \fIinit\fR module during system start-up\&. The \fI-heart\fR command line flag determines if the \fIheart\fR module should start \&.
.LP
If the system should be rebooted because of missing heart-beats, or a terminated Erlang runtime system, the environment variable \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR has to be set before the system is started\&. If this variable is not set, a warning text will be printed but the system will not reboot\&. However, if the hardware watchdog is used, it will trigger a reboot \fIHEART_BEAT_BOOT_DELAY\fR seconds later nevertheless (default is 60)\&. 
.LP
To reboot on the WINDOWS platform \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR can be set to \fIheart -shutdown\fR (included in the Erlang delivery) or of course to any other suitable program which can activate a reboot\&. 
.LP
The hardware watchdog will not be started under Solaris if the environment variable \fIHW_WD_DISABLE\fR is set\&.
.LP
The \fIHEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT\fR and \fIHEART_BEAT_BOOT_DELAY\fR environment variables can be used to configure the heart timeouts, they can be set in the operating system shell before \fIerl -heart\fR is started or can be passed on the command line like this:\fIerl -heart -env HEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT 30\fR\&.
.LP
The value (in seconds) must be in the range 10 < X <= 65535\&.
.LP
It should be noted that if the system clock is adjusted with more than HEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT seconds \fIheart\fR will timeout and try to reboot the system\&. This can happen for example if the system clock is adjusted automatically by use of NTP (Network Time Protocol)\&.

.LP
Sets a temporary reboot command\&. This command is used if a \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR other than the one specified with the environment variable should be used in order to reboot the system\&. The new Erlang runtime system will (if it misbehaves) use the environment variable \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR to reboot\&. 
.LP
The length of the \fICmd\fR command string must be less than 2047 characters\&.

.LP
Clears the temporary boot command\&. If the system terminates, the normal \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR is used to reboot\&.
