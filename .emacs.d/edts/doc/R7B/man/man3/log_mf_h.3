.SH MODULE
log_mf_h \- An Event Handler which Logs Events to Disk
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIlog_mf_h\fR is a \fIgen_event\fR handler module which can be installed in any \fIgen_event\fR process\&. It logs onto disk all events which are sent to an event manager\&. Each event is written as a binary which makes the logging very fast\&. However, a tool such as the \fIReport Browser\fR (\fIrb\fR) must be used in order to read the files\&. The events are written to multiple files\&. When all files have been used, the first one is re-used and overwritten\&. The directory location, the number of files, and the size of each file are configurable\&. The directory will include one file called \fIindex\fR, and report files \fI1, 2, \&.\&.\&.\&.\fR\&.

.LP
Initiates the event handler\&. This function returns \fIArgs\fR, which should be used in a call to \fIgen_event:add_handler(EventMgr, log_mf_h, Args)\fR\&. 
.LP
\fIDir\fR specifies which directory to use for the log files\&. \fIMaxBytes\fR specifies the size of each individual file\&. \fIMaxFiles\fR specifies how many files are used\&. \fIPred\fR is a predicate function used to filter the events\&. If no predicate function is specified, all events are logged\&.
