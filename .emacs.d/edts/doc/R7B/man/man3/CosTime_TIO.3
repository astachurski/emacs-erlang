This operation returns a \fIOverlapType\fR depending on how the interval in the target object and the timerange represented by the UTO object overlap\&. If the OverlapType is \&'OTNoOverlap\&' the out parameter represents the gap between the two intervals\&. If OverlapType is one of the others, the out parameter represents the overlap interval\&. The definitions of the OverlapType\&'s are:

.TP 2
*
\&'OTContainer\&' - target objects lower and upper limits are, respectively, less or equal to and greater or equal to given object\&'s\&.
.TP 2
*
\&'OTContained\&' - target objects lower and upper limits are, respectively, greater or equal to and less or equal to given object\&'s\&.
.TP 2
*
\&'OTOverlap\&' - target objects interval overlap given object\&'s\&.
.TP 2
*
\&'OTNoOverlap\&' - target objects interval do not overlap given object\&'s\&.
