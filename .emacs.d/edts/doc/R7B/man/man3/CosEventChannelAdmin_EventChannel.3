.SH MODULE
CosEventChannelAdmin_EventChannel \-  This module implements an Event Channel interface, which plays the role of a mediator between consumers and suppliers\&. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
An event channel is an object that allows multiple suppliers to communicate with multiple consumers in a highly decoupled, asynchronous manner\&. The event channel is built up incrementally\&. An event channel factory could be used for creating an event channel\&. This factory could be found in OrberEventChannel_EventChannelFactory module\&. When an event channel is created no suppliers or consumers are connected to it\&. Event Channel can implement group communication by serving as a replicator, broadcaster, or multicaster that forward events from one or more suppliers to multiple consumers\&. 
.LP
It is up to the user to decide when an event channel is created and how references to the event channel are obtained\&. By representing the event channel as an object, it has all of the properties that apply to objects\&. One way to manage an event channel is to register it in a naming context, or export it through an operation on an object\&. 
.LP
Any object that possesses an object reference that supports the ProxyPullConsumer interface can perform the following operations:
