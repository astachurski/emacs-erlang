Suppose that [X1, X2, X3, \&.\&.\&., Xn] are \fIindependent\fR random variables with a finite population mean u, a finite population variance V, and a sample mean estimate m(n)\&. The variance of the estimated mean may be equated through the formula Var(m(n)) = S^2(n) / n NOTE: This formula is valid only if all Xi\&'s are independent (uncorrelated)!!! This is normally not the case in simulations\&.

This function computes the mean of a number of samples using the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average technique\&. Suppose that [X1, X2, X3, \&.\&.\&., Xn] are random variables (observations) with finite population mean u\&. Assume we have previously equated a mean value estimate Wn (where W0 may have been simply estimated)\&. Let GP denote the granularity period, ie\&., the time elapsed between any two successive sample measurements, and let MTP denote the moving time period, ie\&., the time within which samples are considered\&. (For example, let GP be 5 ms, and MTP 1 s, which means that the EWMA mean will be based on 200 samples\&.) When we receive a new sample Xnew, the new estimate of the mean will be Wnew = f * Xnew + (1 - f) * Wn, where f = 2 * GP / (GP + MTP)

This function computes the variance of a number of samples using the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average technique\&. Suppose that [X1, X2, X3, \&.\&.\&., Xn] are random variables (observations) with a finite population mean u\&. Also assume we have previously computed a variance value estimate Sn (where S0 may have been simply calculated)\&. Let GP denote the granularity period, ie\&., the time elapsed between any two successive sample measurements\&. Also, let SMTP denote the second moving time period, ie\&., the effective time interval over which values are scanned to calculate an estimate of the variance\&. When we receive a new sample Xnew, the new estimate of the mean will be Snew = g * (Xnew - Wnew)^2 + (1 - g) * Sn, where g = 2 * GP / (GP + SMTP) NOTE: the bias can be shown to be u = 2*(1-f)^2/(2-f), times the variance of Xnew - Wnew (where f is taken from the ewma_mean formula)\&. This may be used to reduce the bias in the calculations, using the formula S\&'n = Sn / u\&. The manager may decide whether to reduce the bias or ignore it\&.

This function computes the variance of a number of samples using the Uniformly Weighted Moving Average technique\&. Suppose that [X1, X2, X3, \&.\&.\&., Xn] are random variables (observations) with finite population mean u, and sample sum SX\&. When we receive a new sample Xnew, the new estimate of the mean will be Wnew = Xnew + (SX - Xold) / N, where Xold is the oldest sample used in the calculation of SX (ie\&., the sample that will be replaced by Xnew when calculating Wnew), and N is the number of samples the calculation of Wnew is based on\&.
