xref \- A Cross Reference Tool for analyzing dependencies between functions, modules, applications and releases\&. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fIxref\fR is a cross reference tool that can be used for finding dependencies between functions, modules, applications and releases\&. 
.LP
\fICalls\fR are pairs (From, To) of functions, modules, applications or releases\&. From is said to call To, and To is said to be used by From\&. Calls between functions are either \fIlocal calls\fR like \fIf()\fR, or \fIexternal calls\fR like \fIm:f()\fR\&. \fIModule data\fR, which are extracted from BEAM files, include local functions, exported functions, local calls and external calls\&. By default, calls to built-in functions ( BIF ) are ignored, but if the option \fIbuiltins\fR, accepted by some of this module s functions, is set to \fItrue\fR, calls to BIFs are included as well\&. It is the analyzing OTP version that decides what functions are BIFs\&. Functional objects are assumed to be called where they are created (and nowhere else)\&. \fIUnresolved calls\fR are calls to \fIapply\fR or \fIspawn\fR with variable module or variable arguments\&. Examples are \fIM:F(a)\fR, \fIapply(M, f, [a])\fR, \fIspawn(m,  f,  Args)\fR\&. The unresolved calls are a subset of the external calls\&. Calls where the function is variable but the module and the number of arguments are known, are resolved by replacing the function with the atom \fI\&'$F_EXPR\&'\fR\&. 
.SS Warning:
.LP
Unresolved calls make module data incomplete, which implies that the results of analyses may be invalid\&.

.LP
\fIApplications\fR are collections of modules\&. The modules  BEAM files are located in the \fIebin\fR subdirectory of the application directory\&. The name of the application directory determines the name and version of the application\&. \fIReleases\fR are collections of applications located in the \fIlib\fR subdirectory of the release directory\&. There is more to read about applications and releases in the Design Principles book\&. 
.LP
\fIXref servers\fR are identified by names, supplied when creating new servers\&. Each xref server holds a set of releases, a set of applications, and a set of modules with module data\&. Xref servers are independent of each other, and all analyses are evaluated in the context of one single xref server (exceptions are the functions \fIm/1\fR and \fId/1\fR which do not use servers at all)\&. The \fImode\fR of an xref server determines what module data are extracted from BEAM files as modules are added to the server\&. Starting with R7, BEAM files contain so called debug information, which is an abstract representation of the code\&. In \fIfunctions\fR mode, which is the default mode, function calls and line numbers are extracted from debug information\&. In \fImodules\fR mode, debug information is ignored if present, but dependencies between modules are extracted from other parts of the BEAM files\&. The \fImodules\fR mode is significantly less time and space consuming than the \fIfunctions\fR mode, but the analyses that can be done are limited\&. 
.LP
An \fIanalyzed module\fR is a module that has been added to an xref server together with its module data\&. A \fIlibrary module\fR is a module located in some directory mentioned in the \fIlibrary path\fR\&. A library module is said to be used if some of its exported functions are used by some analyzed module\&. An \fIunknown module\fR is a module that is neither an analyzed module nor a library module, but whose exported functions are used by some analyzed module\&. An \fIunknown function\fR is a used function that is neither local or exported by any analyzed module nor exported by any library module\&. An  \fIundefined function\fR is an externally used function that is not exported by any analyzed module or library module\&. With this notion, a local function can be an undefined function, namely if it is used externally from some module\&. All unknown functions are also undefined functions; there is a figure in the User s Guide that illustrates this relationship\&. 
.LP
Before any analysis can take place, module data must be \fIset up\fR\&. For instance, the cross reference and the unknown functions are computed when all module data are known\&. The functions that need complete data (\fIanalyze\fR, \fIq\fR, \fIvariables\fR) take care of setting up data automatically\&. Module data need to be set up (again) after calls to any of the \fIadd\fR, \fIreplace\fR, \fIremove\fR, \fIset_library_path\fR or \fIupdate\fR functions\&. 
.LP
The result of setting up module data is the \fICall Graph\fR\&. A (directed) graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of (directed) edges\&. The vertices of the Call Graph are the functions of all module data: local and exported functions of analyzed modules; used BIFs; used exported functions of library modules; and unknown functions\&. The functions \fImodule_info/0, 1\fR added by the compiler are included among the exported functions, but only when called from some module\&. The edges are the function calls of all module data\&. A consequence of the edges being a set is that there is only one edge if a function is used locally or externally several times on one and the same line of code\&. 
.LP
The Call Graph is represented by Erlang terms (the sets are lists), which is suitable for many analyses\&. But for analyses that look at chains of calls, a list representation is much too slow\&. Instead the representation offered by the \fIdigraph\fR module is used\&. The translation of the list representation of the Call Graph - or a subgraph thereof - to the \fIdigraph\fR representation does not come for free, so the language used for expressing queries to be described below has a special operator for this task and a possibility to save the \fIdigraph\fR representation for subsequent analyses\&. 
.LP
In addition to the Call Graph there is a graph called the \fIInter Call Graph\fR\&. This is a graph of calls (From, To) such that there is a chain of calls from From to To in the Call Graph, and each of From and To is an exported function or an unused local function\&. The vertices are the same as for the Call Graph\&. 
.LP
Calls between modules, applications and releases are also directed graphs\&. The \fItypes\fR of the vertices and edges of these graphs are (ranging from the most special to the most general): \fIFun\fR for functions; \fIMod\fR for modules; \fIApp\fR for applications; and \fIRel\fR for releases\&. The following paragraphs will describe the different constructs of the language used for selecting and analyzing parts of the graphs, beginning with the \fIconstants\fR:

Examples of constants are: \fIkernel\fR, \fIkernel->stdlib\fR, \fI[kernel, sasl]\fR, \fI[pg -> mnesia, {tv, mnesia}] : Mod\fR\&. It is an error if an instance of \fIConst\fR does not match any vertex of any graph\&. If there are more than one vertex matching an untyped instance of \fIAtomConst\fR, then the one of the most general type is chosen\&. A list of constants is interpreted as a set of constants, all of the same type\&. A tuple of constants constitute a chain of calls (which may, but does not have to, correspond to an actual chain of calls of some graph)\&. Assigning a type to a list or tuple of \fIConstant\fR is equivalent to assigning the type to each \fIConstant\fR\&. 
.LP
\fIRegular expressions\fR are used as a means to select some of the vertices of a graph\&. A \fIRegExpr\fR consisting of a \fIRegString\fR and a type - an example is \fI"xref_\&.*" : Mod\fR - is interpreted as those modules (or applications or releases, depending on the type) that match the expression\&. Similarly, a \fIRegFunc\fR is interpreted as those vertices of the Call Graph that match the expression\&. An example is \fI"xref_\&.*":"add_\&.*"/"(2|3)"\fR, which matches all \fIadd\fR functions of arity two or three of any of the xref modules\&. Another example, one that matches all functions of arity 10 or more: \fI_:_/"[1-9]\&.+"\fR\&. Here \fI_\fR is an abbreviation for \fI"\&.*"\fR, i\&.e\&. the regular expression that matches everything\&.

There are two kinds of variables: predefined variables and user variables\&. \fIPredefined variables\fR hold set up module data, and cannot be assigned to but only used in queries\&. \fIUser variables\fR on the other hand can be assigned to, and are typically used for temporary results while evaluating a query, and for keeping results of queries for use in subsequent queries\&. The predefined variables are (variables marked with (*) are available in \fIfunctions\fR mode only):

An important notion is that of \fIconversion\fR of expressions\&. The syntax of a cast expression is:

.RE
.LP
The interpretation of the cast operator depends on the named type \fIType\fR, the type of \fIExpression\fR, and the structure of the elements of the interpretation of \fIExpression\fR\&. If the named type is equal to the expression type, no conversion is done\&. Otherwise, the conversion is done one step at a time; \fI(Fun) (App) RE\fR, for instance, is equivalent to \fI(Fun) (Mod) (App) RE\fR\&. Now assume that the interpretation of \fIExpression\fR is a set of constants (functions, modules, applications or releases)\&. If the named type is more general than the expression type, say \fIMod\fR and \fIFun\fR respectively, then the interpretation of the cast expression is the set of modules that have at least one of their functions mentioned in the interpretation of the expression\&. If the named type is more special than the expression type, say \fIFun\fR and \fIMod\fR, then the interpretation is the set of all the functions of the modules (in \fImodules\fR mode, the conversion is partial since the local functions are not known)\&. The conversions to and from applications and releases work analogously\&. For instance, \fI(App) "xref_\&.*" : Mod\fR returns all applications containing at least one module such that \fIxref_\fR is a prefix of the module name\&. 
.LP
Now assume that the interpretation of \fIExpression\fR is a set of calls\&. If the named type is more general than the expression type, say \fIMod\fR and \fIFun\fR respectively, then the interpretation of the cast expression is the set of calls (M1, M2) such that the interpretation of the expression contains a call from some function of M1 to some function of M2\&. If the named type is more special than the expression type, say \fIFun\fR and \fIMod\fR, then the interpretation is the set of all function calls (F1, F2) such that the interpretation of the expression contains a call (M1, M2) and F1 is a function of M1 and F2 is a function of M2 (in \fImodules\fR mode, there are no functions calls, so a cast to \fIFun\fR always yields an empty set)\&. Again, the conversions to and from applications and releases work analogously\&. 
.LP
The interpretation of constants and variables are sets, and those sets can be used as the basis for forming new sets by the application of \fIset operators\fR\&. The syntax:

BinarySetOp ::= \fI+\fR | \fI*\fR | \fI-\fR
.RE
.LP
\fI+\fR, \fI*\fR and \fI-\fR are interpreted as union, intersection and difference respectively: the union of two sets contains the elements of both sets; the intersection of two sets contains the elements common to both sets; and the difference of two sets contains the elements of the first set that are not members of the second set\&. The elements of the two sets must be of the same structure; for instance, a function call cannot be combined with a function\&. But if a cast operator can make the elements compatible, then the more general elements are converted to the less general element type\&. For instance, \fIM + F\fR is equivalent to \fI(Fun) M + F\fR, and \fIE - AE\fR is equivalent to \fIE - (Fun) AE\fR\&. One more example: \fIX * xref : Mod\fR is interpreted as the set of functions exported by the module \fIxref\fR; \fIxref : Mod\fR is converted to the more special type of \fIX\fR (\fIFun\fR, that is) yielding all functions of \fIxref\fR, and the intersection with \fIX\fR (all functions exported by analyzed modules and library modules) is interpreted as those functions that are exported by some module \fIand\fR functions of \fIxref\fR\&.

Two functions (modules, applications, releases) belong to the same strongly connected component if they call each other (in)directly\&. The interpretation of the \fIcomponents\fR operator is the set of strongly connected components of a set of calls\&. The \fIcondensation\fR of a set of calls is a new set of calls between the strongly connected components such that there is an edge between two components if there is some constant of the first component that calls some constant of the second component\&. 
.LP
The interpretation of the \fIof\fR operator is a chain of calls of the second operand (a set of calls) that passes throw all of the vertices of the first operand (a tuple of constants), in the given order\&. The second operand is converted to the type of the first operand\&.

.LP
The \fIXXL\fR operator is defined for the interpretation of any of the LineOp operators applied to a set of function calls\&. The result is that of replacing the function call with a line numbered function call, that is, each of the two functions of the call is replaced by a pair of the function and the line where the function is defined\&.

For both \fICallAt\fR and \fIAllLines\fR it holds that for no list element is \fILineNumbers\fR an empty list; such elements have been removed\&. The constants of \fIcomponent\fR and the integers of \fILineNumbers\fR are sorted and without duplicates\&.
