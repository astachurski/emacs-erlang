.SH MODULE
CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPushSupplier \-  This module implements a ProxyPushSupplier interface which acts as a middleman between push consumer and the event channel\&. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The ProxyPushSupplier interface defines the second step for connecting push consumers to the event channel\&. A proxy supplier is similar to a normal supplier, but includes an additional method for connecting a consumer to the proxy supplier\&. 
.LP
There are a number of exceptions that can be returned from functions in this interface\&. 
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
AlreadyConnected is defined as \fI-record(\&'AlreadyConnected\&', {})\&.\fR
.TP 2
*
CORBA standard BAD_PARAM is defined as \fI-record(\&'BAD_PARAM\&', {\&'OE_ID\&', minor, completion_status})\&.\fR
.RE
.LP
The first exception is defined in the file \fIevent_service\&.hrl\fR and the second one in the file \fIcorba\&.hrl\fR\&. 
.LP
Any object that possesses an object reference that supports the ProxyPushSupplier interface can perform the following operations: 

.SH EXPORTS
.LP
.B
connect_push_consumer(Object, PushConsumer) -> Return
.br
.RS
.TP
Types
Object = #objref
.br
PushConsumer = #objref of PushConsumer type
.br
Return = void

.RE
.RS
.LP
This operation connects PushConsumer object to the ProxyPushSupplier object\&. If a nil object reference is passed CORBA standard \fIBAD_PARAM\fR exception is raised\&. If the ProxyPushSupplier is already connected to a PushConsumer, then the \fIAlreadyConnected exception\fR is raised\&.

disconnect_push_supplier(Object) -> Return

.LP
This operation disconnects proxy push supplier from the event channel and sends a notification about the loss of the connection to the push consumer attached to it\&.
