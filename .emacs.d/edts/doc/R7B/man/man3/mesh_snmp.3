.SH MODULE
mesh_snmp  \- An SNMP Adaptation to Mesh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module implements an SNMP adaptation to basic Mesh\&. The MIB implemented by this adaptation is OTP-MESH-MIB, which is located in the directory \fImibs\fR in the distribution\&. 
.LP
The Mesh SNMP adaptation is started if the environment variable \fIsnmp_adapted\fR is set to \fItrue\fR when the Mesh application is started\&. 
.LP
The Mesh SNMP adaptation requires that the EVA SNMP adaptation is started (and still running)\&. The events and alarms generated by Mesh is converted to traps using the API provided by the EVA SNMP adaptation\&. The traps are normally sent to community "standard trap"; the user has the possibility to change this\&.

This function registers all alarms, used by the Mesh application, in the EVA SNMP adaptation\&. This means that each alarm generated will cause a trap to be sent to the \fICommunity\fR\&. 
.LP
If this function is not called by the user, the traps are automatically sent to community "standard trap"\&.
