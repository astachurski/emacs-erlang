APPLICATION
     mesh  - Mesh

DESCRIPTION
     The measurement handler Mesh is an Operation and Maintenance
     management  application  that  firstly,  provides support to
     applications and managers for creation and control of  meas-
     urement  types  and objects, and secondly, allows control of
     the associated logs.

     Mesh is designed to be  a  distributed  global  application,
     which means that although it may only be running at one node
     at a time, with the other nodes as  standby  nodes,  clients
     may access the Mesh functionality from any node.

     The Mesh  API  can  be  used  to  make  management  protocol
     specific  interfaces  to  Mesh,  for example SNMP, CORBA, or
     HTTP interfaces. Currently, an SNMP interface is included in
     the application; others may follow.

     Mesh uses the Mnesia DBMS to store  data.  This  means  that
     Mnesia  must be running on all nodes where Mesh may run, and
     that the tables Mesh uses must  be  created  and  configured
     correctly. Mesh provides a function that should be called to
     create tables, and to define replicas for Mnesia. This func-
     tion  is  called  _c_r_e_a_t_e__t_a_b_l_e_s,  and takes one parameter, a
     list of nodes. The Mnesia tables will be replicated on these
     nodes;  some  on disk, and some in RAM. It is important that
     these nodes are the same as those where Mesh will run.

     Mesh also uses EVA functionality to send and  log  generated
     events  and alarms. The logs can be examined by a manager at
     a later time, however, the configuration and start of EVA is
     left  to  the  client application programmer (please see the
     EVA User's Guide and manual pages).

     Commonly used statistical functions  may  be  found  in  the
     module _m_e_s_h__l_i_b.


Configuration
     The following configuration parameters are defined  for  the
     Mesh  application  (for more information about configuration
     parameters see application(3)):

       _s_n_m_p__a_d_a_p_t_e_d = _t_r_u_e | _f_a_l_s_e <_o_p_t_i_o_n_a_l>:
           Specifies whether or  not  the  Mesh  SNMP  adaptation
           shall  be  started. The default is _f_a_l_s_e, meaning that
           the adaptation is not started.
