APPLICATION
     inets - Inets

DESCRIPTION
     Inets is a  container  for  Internet  clients  and  servers.
     Currently,  an HTTP server and an FTP client has been incor-
     porated in Inets. The HTTP server is an efficient  implemen-
     tation  of   HTTP  1.0 as defined in  RFC 1945, namely a Web
     server.


Configuration
     It is possible to start a number of Web servers in an embed-
     ded  system  using  the  _s_e_r_v_i_c_e_s  config  parameter from an
     application config file. A minimal application  config  file
     (from  now  on  referred to as _i_n_e_t_s._c_o_n_f) starting two HTTP
     servers typically looks as follows:

     [{inets,
       [{services,[{httpd,"/var/tmp/server_root/conf/8888.conf"},
                   {httpd,"/var/tmp/server_root/conf/8080.conf"}]}]}].

     A server config file is specified for each HTTP server to be
     started.  The  config file syntax and semantics is described
     in httpd(3).

     _i_n_e_t_s._c_o_n_f can be tested by copying the example server  root
     to  a  specific  installation  directory,  as  described  in
     httpd(3). The example below  shows  a  manual  start  of  an
     Erlang  node,  using  _i_n_e_t_s._c_o_n_f,  and the start of two HTTP
     servers listening listen on ports 8888 and 8080.
