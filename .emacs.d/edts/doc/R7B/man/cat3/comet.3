APPLICATION
     comet  - The COM client for Erlang

DESCRIPTION
     Comet, the COM client for Erlang, is a way to call any  COM-
     service  in Windows from an Erlang program. It is a combina-
     tion of a gen_server and a port  program  (or  port  driver)
     that enables Erlang programs to call almost any COM-server.

     Comet uses a gen_server in the module erl_com, together with
     a  port  program (or port driver), to call COM-servers. Both
     the late-binding interface IDispatch and early-binding  vir-
     tual  interfaces  can be used. Erlang types are converted to
     COM types and parameters are returned.

     COM stands for Component Object Model, (or sometimes  Common
     Object  Model),  and is MicroSoft's technique for component-
     based programming. It allows programs on Windows systems, to
     call  other  programs  and  libraries  across language boun-
     daries. It is a competitor to Corba,  but  has  other  func-
     tionality too.

     COM is available on all 32-bit Windows systems, such  as  NT
     4,  Windows  95,  Windows  98 and Windows 2000. Comet can be
     used on any of these.

     With Comet, an Erlang application can use (almost) any  COM-
     service on Windows from Erlang. Examples of what can be done
     include:

       * Opening webpages with Internet Exporer (or Netscape)

       * Reading and writing data from Excel Worksheet

       * Reading and writing from Word

       * Call C-code-libraries an efficient way, without the has-
         sle of creating a port-driver

       * Execute scripts in VBScript or JavaScript

     Each of these examples are described in _c_o_m_e_t__e_x_a_m_p_l_e_s.

     Using Comet for other purposes than those described  in  the
     examples, requires knowledge of COM. COM is a complex topic,
     and there are a lot of books written about it. Three  decent
     references are given below. Some sections of the Comet docu-
     mentation assumes basic knowledge of COM.

CONFIGURATION
     Comet does not use any configuration parameters.
