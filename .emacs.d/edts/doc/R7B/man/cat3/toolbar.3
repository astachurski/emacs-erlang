toolbar(3)          ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION           toolbar(3)



MODULE
     toolbar  -  GUI for Starting Tools and User Contributions

DESCRIPTION
     The toolbar makes it easier  to  use  the  different  Erlang
     tools  - and the user contributions - which are provided. It
     has a graphical user interface with an icon for  each  tool.
     Clicking the icon activates the corresponding tool.

     All tools to be included on the toolbar must have  a  confi-
     guration  file  containing  information  about the tool, for
     example its start function and  help  information  location.
     Configuration files must have the ._t_o_o_l suffix.

     When started, the toolbar automatically  checks  for  *._t_o_o_l
     files  in the current path and adds the corresponding tools.
     For each _e_b_i_n directory found in the path, it will also look
     in  a  _p_r_i_v  directory  next to it. This is a feature of the
     Erlang file structure.
