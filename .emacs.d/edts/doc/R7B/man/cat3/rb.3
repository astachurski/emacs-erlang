MODULE
     rb - The Report Browser Tool

DESCRIPTION
     The Report Browser (RB) tool makes it possible to browse and
     format  error  reports  written  by the error logger handler
     _l_o_g__m_f__h.


EXPORTS
     grep(RegExp)

          Types
               RegExp = string()

          All reports containing the  regular  expression  _R_e_g_E_x_p
          are printed.

          _R_e_g_E_x_p is a string containing the  regular  expression.
          Refer  to  the  module  _r_e_g_e_x_p  in the STDLIB reference
          manual for a definition of valid  regular  expressions.
          They  are  essentially  the  same  as  the UNIX command
          _e_g_r_e_p.

     h()
     help()

          Prints the on-line help information.

     list()
     list(Type)

          Types
               Type = type()
               type() = crash_report | supervisor_report |  error
               | progress

          This  function  lists  all  reports   loaded   in   the
          _r_b__s_e_r_v_e_r.  Each  report  is given a unique number that
          can be used as a reference to the report in the  _s_h_o_w/_1
          function.

          If no _T_y_p_e is given, all reports are listed.

     rescan()
     rescan(Options)

          Types
               Options = [opt()]

          Rescans the report directory. _O_p_t_i_o_n_s is  the  same  as
          for _s_t_a_r_t().

     show()
     show(Report)

          Types
               Report = int() | type()

          If a type argument is given, all loaded reports of this
          type  are printed. If an integer argument is given, the
          report with this reference number  is  printed.  If  no
          argument is given, all reports are shown.

     start()
     start(Options)

          Types
               Options = [opt()]
               opt()  =  {start_log,  FileName}  |   {max,   Max-
               NoOfReports}  |  {report_dir,  DirString} | {type,
               ReportType}
               FileName = string() | standard_io
               MaxNoOfReports = int() | all
               DirString = string()
               ReportType = type() | [type()] | all

          The function _s_t_a_r_t/_1  starts  the  _r_b__s_e_r_v_e_r  with  the
          specified  options,  while  _s_t_a_r_t/_0 starts with default
          options. The _r_b__s_e_r_v_e_r must be started  before  reports
          can  be  browsed.  When  the  _r_b__s_e_r_v_e_r is started, the
          files in the specified directory are scanned. The other
          functions assume that the server has started.

          {_s_t_a_r_t__l_o_g,  _F_i_l_e_N_a_m_e}  starts  logging  to  file.  All
          reports  will be printed to the named file. The default
          is _s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d__i_o.

          {_m_a_x, _M_a_x_N_o_O_f_R_e_p_o_r_t_s}. Controls how  many  reports  the
          _r_b__s_e_r_v_e_r  should read on start-up. This option is use-
          ful as the directory may  contain  20.000  reports.  If
          this option is given, the _M_a_x_N_o_O_f_R_e_p_o_r_t_s latest reports
          will be read. The default is 'all'.

          {_r_e_p_o_r_t__d_i_r, _D_i_r_S_t_r_i_n_g}. Defines  the  directory  where
          the  error log files are located. The default is {_s_a_s_l,
          _e_r_r_o_r__l_o_g_g_e_r__m_f__d_i_r}.

          {_t_y_p_e, _R_e_p_o_r_t_T_y_p_e}. Controls what kind of  reports  the
          _r_b__s_e_r_v_e_r should read on start-up. _R_e_p_o_r_t_T_y_p_e is a sup-
          ported type, 'all', or a list of supported  types.  The
          default is 'all'.
