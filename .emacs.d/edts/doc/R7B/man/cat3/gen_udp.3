MODULE
     gen_udp - Interface to UDP.

DESCRIPTION
     The _g_e_n__u_d_p module is an interface to User Datagram Protocol
     (UDP).

     The possible {_e_r_r_o_r, _R_e_a_s_o_n} results are  described  in  the
     inet manual page.


EXPORTS
     close(Socket) -> ok | {error, Reason}

          Types
               Socket = Reason = term()

          Removes the _S_o_c_k_e_t created with _o_p_e_n/_1 or _o_p_e_n/_2.

     controlling_process(Socket,NewOwner) ->

          Types
               Socket = term()
               NewOwner = pid()

          The process associated with  a  Socket  is  changed  to
          _N_e_w_O_w_n_e_r.  The  _N_e_w_O_w_n_e_r  will  receive  all subsequent
          data.

     open(Port) -> {ok, Socket } | { error, Reason }
     open(Port,Options) -> {ok, Socket } | { error, Reason }

          Types
               Port = integer(0..65535)
               Options = list()
               Socket = term()
               Reason = term()

          Associates a UDP port number (_P_o_r_t)  with  the  calling
          process.  It  returns{_o_k,  _S_o_c_k_e_t}, or {_e_r_r_o_r, _R_e_a_s_o_n}.
          The returned _S_o_c_k_e_t is used to send packets  from  this
          port  with  the  _s_e_n_d/_4  function. _O_p_t_i_o_n_s is a list of
          options associated with this port.

          When UDP packets arrive at the opened _P_o_r_t they will be
          delivered  as  messages  of  the type {_u_d_p, _S_o_c_k_e_t, _I_P,
          _I_n_P_o_r_t_N_o, _P_a_c_k_e_t}

          _I_P and _I_n_P_o_r_t_N_o define the address  from  which  _P_a_c_k_e_t
          came.  _P_a_c_k_e_t is a list of bytes if the option _l_i_s_t was
          specified. _P_a_c_k_e_t is a binary if the option _b_i_n_a_r_y  was
          specified.

          The available options are:

            _l_i_s_t:
                Received _P_a_c_k_e_t is delivered as a list.

            _b_i_n_a_r_y:
                Received _P_a_c_k_e_t is delivered as a binary.

            common _i_n_e_t options:
                The common _i_n_e_t options available  are  described
                in  the  setopts/2  function  in  the _i_n_e_t manual
                page.

          If you set Port to 0, the underlying  Operating  System
          assigns  a  free UDP port. (You can find out which port
          by calling _i_n_e_t:_p_o_r_t(_S_o_c_k_e_t).)

          If any of the following functions  are  called  with  a
          _S_o_c_k_e_t that was not opened by the calling process, they
          will return {_e_r_r_o_r,  _n_o_t__o_w_n_e_r}.  The  ownership  of  a
          _S_o_c_k_e_t  can  be  transferred  to  another  process with
          _c_o_n_t_r_o_l_l_i_n_g__p_r_o_c_e_s_s/_2.

     recv(Socket,  Length)  ->  {ok,{Address,  Port,  Packet}}  |
     {error, Reason}
     recv(Socket, Length, Timeout)

          Types
               Socket = socket()
               Address  =  {  integer(),  integer(),   integer(),
               integer()}
               Port = integer(0..65535)
               Length = integer()
               Packet = list() | binary()
               Timeout = integer()
               Reason = atom()

          This function receives a packet from a socket  in  pas-
          sive mode.

          The optional _T_i_m_e_o_u_t parameter specifies a  timeout  in
          milliseconds. The default value is _i_n_f_i_n_i_t_y.

     send(S,Address,Port,Packet) -> ok | {error, Reason}

          Types
               Address  =  {  integer(),  integer(),   integer(),
               integer()} | atom() | string()
               Port = integer(0..65535)
               Packet = [byte()] | binary()
               Reason = term()

          Sends _P_a_c_k_e_t to the specified address (address,  port).
          It returns _o_k, or {_e_r_r_o_r, _R_e_a_s_o_n}. _A_d_d_r_e_s_s can be an IP
          address expressed as a tuple, for example {_1_9_2,  _0,  _0,
          _1}.  It can also be a host name expressed as an atom or
          a string, for example 'somehost.some.domain'.  _P_o_r_t  is
          an  integer,  and _P_a_c_k_e_t is either a list of bytes or a
          binary.
