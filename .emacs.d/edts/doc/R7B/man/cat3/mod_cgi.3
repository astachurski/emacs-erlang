mod_cgi(3)          ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION           mod_cgi(3)



MODULE
     mod_cgi - Invoking of CGI scripts.

DESCRIPTION
     This module makes it possible to execute vanilla CGI (Common
     Gateway  Interface)  scripts  in  the  server.  A  file that
     matches the definition of a ScriptAlias config directive  is
     treated  as  a  CGI  script. A CGI script is executed by the
     server and its output is returned to the client.

     Support for CGI-1.1 is implemented in  accordance  with  the
     CGI-1.1 specification <http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/>.

  Note:
     CGI is currently available for Erlang/OTP running on a  UNIX
     platform. These number of platforms will be increased.



EWSAPI MODULE INTERACTION
     Uses the following EWSAPI interaction data, if available:

       {_n_e_w__r_e_q_u_e_s_t__u_r_i, _N_e_w_R_e_q_u_e_s_t_U_R_I}:
           as defined in mod_actions(3).

       {_r_e_m_o_t_e__u_s_e_r, _R_e_m_o_t_e_U_s_e_r}:
           as defined in mod_auth(3).

     Uses the following EWSAPI functions:

       * mod_alias:real_name/3

       * mod_alias:real_script_name/3

       * mod_cgi:env/3

       * mod_cgi:status_code:env/1

     This module furthermore exports a batch of functions  to  be
     used by other EWSAPI modules:

EXPORTS
     env(Info,Script,AfterScript) -> EnvString

          Types
               Info = mod_record()
               Script = AfterScript = EnvString = string()

  Note:
     This function should only be used when implementing  CGI-1.1
     functionality on UNIX platforms.

mod_cgi(3)          ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION           mod_cgi(3)



     _o_p_e_n__p_o_r_t/_2 is normally used to start and interact with  CGI
     scripts.  _o_p_e_n__p_o_r_t/_2  takes  an  external program as input;
     _e_n_v(_1) (GNU Shell Utility) is typically used in the case  of
     a  CGI  script.  _e_n_v(_1) execute the CGI script in a modified
     environment and  takes  the  CGI  script  and  a  string  of
     environment variables as input. _e_n_v/_3 returns an appropriate
     CGI-1.1 environment variable string to be used for this pur-
     pose.  The  environment  variables  in  the string are those
     defined       in       the       CGI-1.1       specification
     <http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/>. _m_o_d__r_e_c_o_r_d() is a record
     as defined in  the  EWSAPI  Module  Programming  section  of
     _h_t_t_p_d(_3).

     status_code(CGIOutput) -> {ok,StatusCode} | {error,Reason}

          Types
               CGIOutput = Reason = string()
               StatusCode = integer()

          Certain output from CGI scripts has a special  meaning,
          as     described     in     the    CGI    specification
          <http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/>,  for   example   if
          "_L_o_c_a_t_i_o_n: _h_t_t_p://_w_w_w._y_a_h_o_o._c_o_m\_n\_n" is returned from a
          CGI script the client gets automatically redirected  to
          Yahoo!   <http://www.yahoo.com>,  using  the  HTTP  302
          status code (RFC 1945).
