NAME
     erl_global - Access globally registered names

DESCRIPTION
     This module provides support for registering, looking up and
     unregistering  names  in  the Erlang Global module. For more
     information, see the description of Global in the  reference
     manual.


EXPORTS
     char **erl_global_names(fd,count)

          Types
               int fd;
               int *count;

          Retrieve a list of all known global names.

          _f_d is an open descriptor to an Erlang connection.

          _c_o_u_n_t is the address of an integer, or NULL.  If  _c_o_u_n_t
          is  not  NULL,  it  will  be set by the function to the
          number of names found.

          On success, the function returns an array  of  strings,
          each  containing  a  single  registered  name, and sets
          _c_o_u_n_t to the number of names found. The array  is  ter-
          minated by a single NULL pointer. On failure, the func-
          tion returns NULL and _c_o_u_n_t is not modified.

  Note:
     It is the caller's responsibility to free the  array  after-
     wards.  It  has been allocated by the function with a single
     call to _m_a_l_l_o_c(), so a single _f_r_e_e() is all that  is  neces-
     sary.


     int erl_global_register(fd,name,pid)

          Types
               int fd;
               const char *name;
               ETERM *pid;

          This function registers a name in Global.

          _f_d is an open descriptor to an Erlang connection.

          _n_a_m_e is the name to register in Global.

erl_global(3)          C LIBRARY FUNCTIONS          erl_global(3)



          _p_i_d is the pid that should  be  associated  with  _n_a_m_e.
          This   is  the  value  that  Global  will  return  when
          processes request the location of _n_a_m_e.

          The function returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure.

     int erl_global_unregister(fd,name)

          Types
               int fd;
               const char *name;

          This function unregisters a name from Global.

          _f_d is an open descriptor to an Erlang connection.

          _n_a_m_e is the name to unregister from Global.

          The function returns 0 on success, or -1 on failure.

     ETERM *erl_global_whereis(fd,name,node)

          Types
               int fd;
               const char *name;
               char *node;

          _f_d is an open descriptor to an Erlang connection.

          _n_a_m_e is the name that is to be looked up in Global.

          If _n_o_d_e is not NULL, it is a pointer to a buffer  where
          the  function  can  fill  in the name of the node where
          _n_a_m_e  is  found.  _n_o_d_e  can  be  passed   directly   to
          _e_r_l__c_o_n_n_e_c_t() if necessary.

          On success, the function returns an Erlang Pid contain-
          ing  the  address  of  the given name, and node will be
          initialized to the nodename where  _n_a_m_e  is  found.  On
          failure  NULL  will  be  returned  and _n_o_d_e will not be
          modified.
