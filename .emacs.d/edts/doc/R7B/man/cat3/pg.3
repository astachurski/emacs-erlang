MODULE
     pg - Distributed, Named Process Groups

DESCRIPTION
     This (experimental) module implements process groups. A pro-
     cess group is a group of processes that can be accessed by a
     common name. For example, a group named _f_o_o_b_a_r can include a
     set  of  processes  as members of this group and they can be
     located on different nodes.

     When messages are sent to the named group,  all  members  of
     the  group receive the message. The messages are serialized.
     If the process _P_1 sends the message _M_1  to  the  group,  and
     process _P_2 simultaneously sends message _M_2, then all members
     of the group receive the two messages in the same order.  If
     members of a group terminate, they are automatically removed
     from the group.

     This module is not complete. The module is inspired  by  the
     ISIS system and the causal order protocol of the ISIS system
     should also be implemented. At the moment, all messages  are
     serialized by sending them through a group master process.


EXPORTS
     create(PgName)

          Creates an empty group  named  _P_g_N_a_m_e  on  the  current
          node.

     create(PgName, Node)

          Creates an epmty group on the node _N_o_d_e.

     join(PgName, Pid)

          Joins the Pid _P_i_d to the process group _P_g_N_a_m_e.

     send(Pgname, Message)

          Sends the tuple {_p_g__m_e_s_s_a_g_e, _F_r_o_m, _P_g_N_a_m_e, _M_e_s_s_a_g_e}  to
          all members of the process group.

     esend(PgName, Mess)

          Sends the tuple {_p_g__m_e_s_s_a_g_e, _F_r_o_m, _P_g_N_a_m_e, _M_e_s_s_a_g_e}  to
          all  members  of  the process group, except the current
          node.
