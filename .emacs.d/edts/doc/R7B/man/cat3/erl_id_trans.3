MODULE
     erl_id_trans - An Identity Parse Transform

DESCRIPTION
     This module performs an  identity  parse  transformation  of
     Erlang  code. It is included as an example for users who may
     wish to write their own parse transformers.  If  the  option
     {_p_a_r_s_e__t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m,  _M_o_d_u_l_e} is passed to the compiler, a user
     written function _p_a_r_s_e__t_r_a_n_s_f_o_r_m/_2 is called by the compiler
     before the code is checked for errors.


EXPORTS
     parse_transform(Forms, Options) -> Forms

          Types
               Forms = [erlang_form()]
               Options = [compiler_options()]

          Performs an identity transformation on Erlang forms, as
          an example.

Parse Transformations
     Parse transformations are used if a programmer wants to  use
     Erlang  syntax,  but  with different semantics. The original
     Erlang code is then transformed into other Erlang code.

  Note:
     Programmers are strongly advised  not  to  engage  in  parse
     transformations  and  no  support  is  offered  for problems
     encountered.
