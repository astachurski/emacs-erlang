MODULE
     os_sup - This module,  together  with  some  dedicated  UNIX
     processes,  implements  a  message  passing service from the
     Solaris operating system to the error logger in  the  Erlang
     runtime   system.  The  Solaris  (SunOS  5.x)  messages  are
     retrieved from the syslog-daemon, syslogd.

DESCRIPTION
     This module starts a server written  in  Erlang  (and  later
     referenced only as server), which receives messages from the
     Solaris operating system. The messages are  tagged  with  an
     atom  and  subsequently forwarded to the _e_r_r_o_r__l_o_g_g_e_r in the
     Erlang runtime system. If the atom is  _s_t_d__e_r_r_o_r,  the  mes-
     sages are handled the same way as the bulk of internal error
     messages in the Erlang runtime system.

     This module, together  with  the  dedicated  UNIX-processes,
     makes  a number of reconfigurations to the Solaris operating
     system when the service  is  enabled.  These  configurations
     include:

       * the installation of a new configuration file for _s_y_s_l_o_g_d

       * the creation of a named pipe

       * the start of a port program.

     As a consequence of these modifications:

       1.  _s_y_s_l_o_g_d writes messages of interest to the named pipe

       2.  the port program reads messages from  the  named  pipe
           and forwards them to the server

       3.  the server delivers them to the error  logger  of  the
           Erlang runtime system.

     When the service is disabled, the original configuration  is
     restored.


EXPORTS
     start() -> Result

          Types
               Result = {ok,  Pid}  |  {error,  {already_started,
               Pid}}
               Pid = pid()

          This function starts the server together with its dedi-
          cated UNIX processes. It returns {_o_k, _P_i_d} if the start
          was successful, otherwise {_e_r_r_o_r, _a_l_r_e_a_d_y__s_t_a_r_t_e_d}.

     start_link() -> Result

          Types
               Result = {ok,  Pid}  |  {error,  {already_started,
               Pid}}
               Pid = pid()

          This function starts the server together with its dedi-
          cated  UNIX processes. The caller is also linked to the
          server. It returns {_o_k, _P_i_d} if the start was  success-
          ful, otherwise {_e_r_r_o_r, _a_l_r_e_a_d_y__s_t_a_r_t_e_d} .

     stop() -> Result

          Types
               Result = ok | not_started

          This function stops the server and restores the  origi-
          nal  configuration  of the operating system. It returns
          _o_k if successful, otherwise _n_o_t__s_t_a_r_t_e_d.

Operation
       1.  This module is normally started by the _s_u_p_e_r_v_i_s_o_r  and
           _s_u_p_e_r_v_i_s_o_r__b_r_i_d_g_e  behaviours.  Consequently, the user
           should not call the functions described above.

       2.  This module cannot be run in multiple instances on the
           same  hardware.  Special  care must be taken if two or
           more Erlang nodes execute on the same  hardware  plat-
           form  so  that  only one node uses this service _i_n _a_n_y
           _o_n_e _i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e.

       3.  This module requires that a number of actions be  been
           taken prior to starting it. These actions must be per-
           formed with _r_o_o_t privileges on  SunOS  5  and  include
           change  of ownership and file privileges of an execut-
           able binary file, and copying and creating a  modified
           copy  of  the configuration file for the syslog-daemon
           _s_y_s_l_o_g_d. In addition, a  the  following  configuration
           parameters must be set.

             (A) implement the server using _g_e_n__s_e_r_v_e_r.

             (B) implement protection  against  starting  two  or
                 more  instances  of  the  service  on  the  same
                 hardware platform.
