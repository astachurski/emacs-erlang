MODULE
     CosNotifyFilter_FilterAdmin -

DESCRIPTION
     To get access to the record definitions for  the  structures
     use:
      -_i_n_c_l_u_d_e__l_i_b("_c_o_s_N_o_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e/*._h_r_l").

     All objects, which inherit this interface, export  functions
     described in this module.


EXPORTS
     add_filter(Object, Filter) -> FilterID

          Types
               Object = #objref
               Filter = #objref
               FilterID = long()

          This operation connects a  new  _F_i_l_t_e_r  to  the  target
          object.  This  _F_i_l_t_e_r will, together with other associ-
          ated _F_i_l_t_e_r_s, be used to select events  to  forward.  A
          unique  Id  is  returned  and  should  be used if we no
          longer want to consult the given _F_i_l_t_e_r.

     remove_filter(Object, FilterID) -> ok

          Types
               Object = #objref
               FilterID = long()

          If a certain _F_i_l_t_e_r no longer should be associated with
          the  target  object this operation must be used. Events
          will no longer be tested against the _F_i_l_t_e_r  associated
          with the given Id.

     get_filter(Object, FilterID) -> Reply

          Types
               Object = #objref
               FilterID = long()
               Reply      =      Filter      |      {'EXCEPTION',
               #'CosNotifyFilter_FilterNotFound'{}}
               Filter = #objref

          If the target object is associated with a _F_i_l_t_e_r match-
          ing  the given Id the reference will be returned. If no
          such _F_i_l_t_e_r is known by the target object an  exception
          is raised.

     get_all_filters(Object) -> FilterIDSeq

          Types
               Object = #objref
               FilterIDSeq = [FilterID]
               FilterID = long()

          Id's for all _F_i_l_t_e_r objects associated with the  target
          object is returned by this operation.

     remove_all_filters(Object) -> ok

          Types
               Object = #objref

          If we want to remove all _F_i_l_t_e_r_s  associated  with  the
          target object we can use this function.
