MODULE
     mod_security - Security Audit and Trailing Functionality

DESCRIPTION
     This module serves as a filter  for  authenticated  requests
     handled  in  mod_auth.  It  provides possibility to restrict
     users from access for a specified amount  of  time  if  they
     fail to authenticate several times. It logs failed authenti-
     cation as well as blocking of users, and  it  also  calls  a
     configurable call-back module when the events occur.

     There is also an API to manually  block,  unblock  and  list
     blocked users or users, who have been authenticated within a
     configurable amount of time.

     This module understands the following  configuration  direc-
     tives:

       * <Directory>

       * SecurityDataFile

       * SecurityMaxRetries

       * SecurityBlockTime

       * SecurityFailExpireTime

       * SecurityAuthTimeout

       * SecurityCallbackModule

     _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_y_D_a_t_a_F_i_l_e sets the name of the security modules for a
     directory.  The  filename can be either absolute or relative
     to the _S_e_r_v_e_r_R_o_o_t. This file is  used  to  store  persistent
     data for the mod_security module.

  Note:
     Several directories can have the same _S_e_c_u_r_i_t_y_D_a_t_a_F_i_l_e.

     authenticate  a user has before he is blocked out. If a user
     successfully authenticates  when  he  is  blocked,  he  will
     receive a 403 (Forbidden) response from the server.

  Note:
     For security reasons, failed authentications  made  by  this
     user  will  return a message 401 (Unauthorized), even if the
     user is blocked.

The SecurityCallbackModule
     The SecurityCallbackModule is a user written module that can
     receive  events  from  the  mod_security EWSAPI module. This
     module  only  exports  one  function,  event/4,   which   is
     described below.

EXPORTS
     event(What, Port, Dir, Data) -> ignored
     event(What, Address, Port, Dir, Data) -> ignored

               What = [Info]
               Info = {Name, Value}

          _e_v_e_n_t/_4 or _e_v_e_n_t/_4 is called whenever an  event  occurs
          in the mod_security EWSAPI module (_e_v_e_n_t/_4 is called if
          Address is undefined and _e_v_e_n_t/_5 otherwise).  The  _W_h_a_t
          argument specifies the type of event that has occurred,
          and should be one of the following  reasons;  _a_u_t_h__f_a_i_l
          (a  failed  user authentication), _u_s_e_r__b_l_o_c_k (a user is
          being blocked from access) or _u_s_e_r__u_n_b_l_o_c_k (a  user  is
          being removed from the block list).

  Note:
     Note that the _u_s_e_r__u_n_b_l_o_c_k event is  not  triggered  when  a
     user  is  removed  from  the block list explicitly using the
     _u_n_b_l_o_c_k__u_s_e_r function.
