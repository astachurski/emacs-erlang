MODULE
     heart - Heartbeat Monitoring of an Erlang Runtime System.

DESCRIPTION
     The _h_e_a_r_t module sends periodic heartbeats  to  an  external
     port  program, which is also named heart. The purpose of the
     heart port program is to check that the Erlang runtime  sys-
     tem  it is supervising is still running. If the port program
     has not received any  heartbeats  within  _H_E_A_R_T__B_E_A_T__T_I_M_E_O_U_T
     (default is 60 seconds) from the last one, the system can be
     rebooted. Also, if the system is equipped  with  a  hardware
     watchdog  timer  and is running Solaris, the watchdog can be
     used to supervise the entire system.

     This module is started by  the  _i_n_i_t  module  during  system
     start-up.  The  -_h_e_a_r_t  command  line flag determines if the
     _h_e_a_r_t module should start .

     If the system should be rebooted because of  missing  heart-
     beats,  or  a terminated Erlang runtime system, the environ-
     ment variable _H_E_A_R_T__C_O_M_M_A_N_D has to be set before the  system
     is started. If this variable is not set, a warning text will
     be printed but the system will not reboot. However,  if  the
     hardware   watchdog  is  used,  it  will  trigger  a  reboot
     _H_E_A_R_T__B_E_A_T__B_O_O_T__D_E_L_A_Y seconds later nevertheless (default is
     60).

     To reboot on the WINDOWS platform _H_E_A_R_T__C_O_M_M_A_N_D can  be  set
     to  _h_e_a_r_t  -_s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n (included in the Erlang delivery) or of
     course to any other suitable program which  can  activate  a
     reboot.

     The hardware watchdog will not be started under  Solaris  if
     the environment variable _H_W__W_D__D_I_S_A_B_L_E is set.

     The _H_E_A_R_T__B_E_A_T__T_I_M_E_O_U_T and _H_E_A_R_T__B_E_A_T__B_O_O_T__D_E_L_A_Y environment
     variables  can be used to configure the heart timeouts, they
     can be set in the operating system shell before  _e_r_l  -_h_e_a_r_t
     is  started  or  can  be  passed  on  the  command line like
     this:_e_r_l -_h_e_a_r_t -_e_n_v _H_E_A_R_T__B_E_A_T__T_I_M_E_O_U_T _3_0.

     The value (in seconds) must be in the range 10 < X <= 65535.

     It should be noted that if the system clock is adjusted with
     more  than HEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT seconds _h_e_a_r_t will timeout and
     try to reboot the system. This can happen for example if the
     system  clock  is adjusted automatically by use of NTP (Net-
     work Time Protocol).

heart(3)            ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION             heart(3)



     start() -> {ok, Pid} | ignore | {error, What}

          Types
               Pid = pid()
               What = void()

          Starts the heart program. This function returns  _i_g_n_o_r_e
          if the -_h_e_a_r_t command line flag is not supplied.

     set_cmd(Cmd) -> ok | {error, {bad_cmd, Cmd}}

          Types
               Cmd = string()

          Sets a temporary reboot command. This command  is  used
          if  a  _H_E_A_R_T__C_O_M_M_A_N_D  other than the one specified with
          the environment variable should be  used  in  order  to
          reboot  the  system. The new Erlang runtime system will
          (if  it  misbehaves)  use  the   environment   variable
          _H_E_A_R_T__C_O_M_M_A_N_D to reboot.

          The length of the _C_m_d command string must be less  than
          2047 characters.

     clear_cmd() -> ok

          Clears the temporary boot command. If the  system  ter-
          minates, the normal _H_E_A_R_T__C_O_M_M_A_N_D is used to reboot.
