ordsets(3)          ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION           ordsets(3)



MODULE
     ordsets - Functions for Manipulating Sets as Ordered Lists

DESCRIPTION
     Sets are collections of elements with no duplicate elements.
     An  _o_r_d_s_e_t  is  a  representation of a set, where an ordered
     list is used to store the elements of the  set.  An  ordered
     list is more efficient than an unordered list.

     This module provides  exactly  the  same  interface  as  the
     module _s_e_t_s but with a defined representation.
