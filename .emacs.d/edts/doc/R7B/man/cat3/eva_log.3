MODULE
     eva_log  - Log functionality for events and alarms in EVA

DESCRIPTION
     The EVA log service uses the generic Log Control service  to
     implement log functionality for events and alarms defined in
     EVA.

     In the rest of this description, the term  _e_v_e_n_t  refers  to
     both events and alarms as defined in EVA.

     This log functionality supports logging of events from  EVA.
     It uses the module _d_i_s_k__l_o_g for logging of events, using the
     internal log  format  defined  by  _d_i_s_k__l_o_g.  There  can  be
     several logs active at the same time. Each log uses a filter
     function to decide whether an event should be stored in  the
     log or not.

     There are several ways to control whether an event should be
     stored  in a log or not. First of all, _e_v_a__l_o_g checks if the
     _l_o_g flag in _e_v_e_n_t_T_a_b_l_e is set (see _e_v_a(_3)). If it is set  to
     _f_a_l_s_e, the event is not stored in any log, even if there are
     logs that are configured to log the event. In this way, log-
     ging of individual events can be turned on/off by a manager.
     If the _l_o_g flag is  _t_r_u_e,  _e_v_a__l_o_g  checks  the  operational
     status  of  the log. If it is _d_o_w_n, the event is not stored.
     If it is _u_p, the associated filter function  is  called.  If
     this  function  returns _t_r_u_e, the event is stored, otherwise
     it is discarded. To summarize, all these conditions must  be
     true for an event to be stored:

       * The _l_o_g flag for the event is _t_r_u_e.

       * The operational status for the log is _u_p.

       * The filter function  for  the  log  returns  _t_r_u_e,  when
         applied to the event.

     There is a concept of a default log. The default log is used
     to  log any event that has the _l_o_g flag in _e_v_e_n_t_T_a_b_l_e set to
     _t_r_u_e, but no log is currently able to store  the  event  (or
     there  is  no other log defined to log the event). The usage
     of the default log is optional.


EXPORTS
     close(Name) -> ok

          Types
               Name = string()

eva_log(3)          ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION           eva_log(3)



          Closes an event log.

     get_logs() -> [#eva_log]

          Returns all event logs known  to  _e_v_a__l_o_g.  The  record
          #_e_v_a__l_o_g is defined in the file _e_v_a__l_o_g._h_r_l.

     open(Name, FilterFunction, WrapTime) -> ok | {error, Reason}

          Types
               Name = string()
               FilterFunction = {M, F, A}
               M = F = atom()
               A = list()
               WrapTime = integer()

          Makes _e_v_a__l_o_g aware of the log _N_a_m_e. The log must be an
          open _d_i_s_k__l_o_g log, with log format _i_n_t_e_r_n_a_l. This func-
          tion will call  _l_o_g:_o_p_e_n(_N_a_m_e,  _e_v_a__l_o_g,  _W_r_a_p_T_i_m_e)  in
          order  to  register  the log in the generic Log Control
          service.

          The _F_i_l_t_e_r_F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n is used when an  event  is  received
          from  EVA.  It  is  then called as _M:_F(_E_v_e_n_t ++ _A), and
          supposed to return _t_r_u_e if the event should  be  stored
          in  the log. All other return values makes the event be
          discarded. The filter function can be exchanged  during
          runtime, by using _s_e_t__f_i_l_t_e_r/_2.

     set_filter(Name, FilterFunction)

          Types
               Name = string()
               FilterFunction = {M, F, A}
               M = F = atom()
               A = list()

          Changes the filter function for the event log.

     start_link()
     start_link(DefaultLog) -> {ok, Pid} | {error, Reason}

          Types
               DefaultLog = {Name, WrapTime} | false
               Name = string()
               WrapTime = integer()

          Starts the eva log service. This function can  be  used
          to include the service in a supervisor. Normally, func-
          tions in the supervisor _e_v_a__s_u_p can be used instead.

eva_log(3)          ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION           eva_log(3)



          _D_e_f_a_u_l_t_L_o_g is either the name  and  wrap  time  of  the
          default  log  to use, or _f_a_l_s_e. If it is not _f_a_l_s_e, the
          log must have been created with _d_i_s_k__l_o_g, just  as  any
          other  log (see _o_p_e_n/_3). The default log is used to log
          any event that has the _l_o_g flag set to true in  _e_v_e_n_t_T_-
          _a_b_l_e,  but no log has actually logged the event, either
          because there was no such log, or the  log  had  opera-
          tional status _d_o_w_n. If the _D_e_f_a_u_l_t_L_o_g argument is omit-
          ted, it defaults to _f_a_l_s_e. If the default log is  used,
          it  will  be made known to the generic Log Control ser-
          vice as _l_o_g:_o_p_e_n(_N_a_m_e, _e_v_a__l_o_g, _W_r_a_p_T_i_m_e).
