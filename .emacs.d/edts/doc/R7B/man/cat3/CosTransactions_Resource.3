     CosTransactions_Resource -

DESCRIPTION
     To get access to the record definitions for  the  structures
     use:
      -
     _i_n_c_l_u_d_e__l_i_b("_c_o_s_T_r_a_n_s_a_c_t_i_o_n_s/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e/_C_o_s_T_r_a_n_s_a_c_t_i_o_n_s._h_r_l").


EXPORTS
     commit(Resource) -> Return

          Types
               Resource = #objref
               Return = ok | {'EXCEPTION', E}
               E     =     #'CosTransactions_NotPrepared'{}     |
               #'CosTransactions_HeuristicRollback'{}           |
               #'CosTransactions_HeuristicMixed'{}              |
               #'CosTransactions_HeuristicHazard'{}

          This operation instructs the  Resource  to  commit  all
          changes made as a part of the transaction.

          The Resource can raise:

            * Heuristic Exception - if a  Heuristic  decision  is
              made  which  differ  from  the  true outcome of the
              transaction. The Resource must remember the Heuris-
              tic  outcome  until  the  _f_o_r_g_e_t  operation is per-
              formed.

     commit_one_phase(Resource) -> Return

          Types
               Resource = #objref
               Return = ok | {'EXCEPTION', E}
               E   =    #'CosTransactions_HeuristicHazard'{}    |
               #'CosTransactions_TransactionRolledBack'{}

          If possible, the Resource  should  commit  all  changes
          made  as  part of the transaction, else it should raise
          the TRANSACTION_ROLLEDBACK  exception.  This  operation
          can  only  be used if the Resource is the only child of
          its parent.

     forget(Resource) -> Return

          Types
               Resource = #objref
               Return = ok

          This operation informs the Resource that it is safe  to
          forget any Heuristic decisions and the knowledge of the
          transaction.

     prepare(Resource) -> Return

          Types
               Resource = #objref
               Return = Vote | {'EXCEPTION', E}
               Vote = 'VoteReadOnly' | 'VoteCommit' |  'VoteRoll-
               back'
               E    =    #'CosTransactions_HeuristicMixed'{}    |
               #'CosTransactions_HeuristicHazard'{}

          This operation is invoked on the Resource to begin  the
          two-phase commit protocol.

          The Resource can reply:

            * 'VoteReadOnly' - if no  persistent  data  has  been
              modified  by the transaction. The Resource can for-
              get all knowledge of the transaction.

            * 'VoteCommit' - if the Resource  has  been  prepared
              and  is able to write all the data needed to commit
              the transaction to stable storage.

            * 'VoteRollback' - under any circumstanses  but  must
              do  so if none of the alternatives above are appli-
              cable.

            * Heuristic Exception - if a  Heuristic  decision  is
              made  which  differ  from  the  true outcome of the
              transaction. The Resource must remember the Heuris-
              tic  outcome  until  the  _f_o_r_g_e_t  operation is per-
              formed.

     rollback(Resource) -> Return

          Types
               Resource = #objref
               Return = ok | {'EXCEPTION', E}
               E   =    #'CosTransactions_HeuristicCommit'{}    |
               #'CosTransactions_HeuristicMixed'{}              |
               #'CosTransactions_HeuristicHazard'{}

          This operation instructs the Resource to  rollback  all
          changes made as a part of the transaction.

          The Resource can raise:

            * Heuristic Exception - if a  Heuristic  decision  is
