MODULE
     CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPushConsumer -  This module imple-
     ments  a ProxyPushConsumer interface which acts as a middle-
     man between push supplier and the event channel.

DESCRIPTION
     The ProxyPushConsumer interface defines the second step  for
     connecting push suppliers to the event channel. A proxy con-
     sumer is similar to a normal consumer, but includes an addi-
     tional  method for connecting a supplier to the proxy consu-
     mer.

     There are a number of exceptions that can be  returned  from
     functions in this interface.

       * AlreadyConnected         is          defined          as
         -_r_e_c_o_r_d('_A_l_r_e_a_d_y_C_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d', {}).

       * Disconnected is defined as -_r_e_c_o_r_d('_D_i_s_c_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d', {}).

     These exceptions are defined in the file _e_v_e_n_t__s_e_r_v_i_c_e._h_r_l.

     Any object that possesses an object reference that  supports
     the  ProxyPushConsumer  interface  can perform the following
     operations:


EXPORTS
     connect_push_supplier(Object, PushSupplier) -> Return

          Types
               Object = #objref
               PushSupplier = #objref of PushSupplier type
               Return = void

          This operation  connects  PushSupplier  object  to  the
          ProxyPushConsumer object. A nil object reference can be
          passed to this operation. If so a channel cannot invoke
          the disconnect_push_supplier operation on the supplier;
          the supplier  may  be  disconnected  from  the  channel
          without  being  informed.  If  the ProxyPushConsumer is
          already  connected  to   a   PushSupplier,   then   the
          _A_l_r_e_a_d_y_C_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d _e_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n is raised.

     disconnect_push_consumer(Object) -> Return

          Types
               Object = #objref
               Return = void

          This operation disconnects proxy push consumer from the
          event  channel.  Sends a notification about the loss of

          unless  nil  object reference was passed at the connec-

               Object = #objref
               Data = any
               Return = void

          This operation sends event data to all connected consu-
          mers  via the event channel. If the event communication
          has already  been  disconnected,  the  _D_i_s_c_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d  is
          raised.
