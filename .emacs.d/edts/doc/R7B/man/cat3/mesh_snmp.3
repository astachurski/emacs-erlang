MODULE
     mesh_snmp  - An SNMP Adaptation to Mesh

DESCRIPTION
     This module implements an SNMP adaptation to basic Mesh. The
     MIB implemented by this adaptation is OTP-MESH-MIB, which is
     located in the directory _m_i_b_s in the distribution.

     The Mesh SNMP adaptation is started if the environment vari-
     able  _s_n_m_p__a_d_a_p_t_e_d  is set to _t_r_u_e when the Mesh application
     is started.

     The Mesh SNMP adaptation requires that the EVA SNMP  adapta-
     tion  is  started (and still running). The events and alarms
     generated by Mesh is converted to traps using the  API  pro-
     vided  by  the  EVA  SNMP adaptation. The traps are normally
     sent to community "standard trap"; the user has  the  possi-
     bility to change this.


EXPORTS
     register_alarms(Community) -> void()

          Types
               Community = string()

          This function registers all alarms, used  by  the  Mesh
          application,  in  the  EVA  SNMP adaptation. This means
          that each alarm generated will cause a trap to be  sent
          to the _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_y.

          If this function is not called by the user,  the  traps
          are automatically sent to community "standard trap".

     register_events(Community) -> void()

          Types
               Community = string()

          This function registers all events, used  by  the  Mesh
          application,  in  the  EVA  SNMP adaptation. This means
          that each event generated will cause a trap to be  sent
          to the _C_o_m_m_u_n_i_t_y.

          If this function is not called by the user,  the  traps
          are automatically sent to community "standard trap".
