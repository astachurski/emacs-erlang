MODULE
     erl_boot_server - Boot Server for Other Erlang Machines

DESCRIPTION
     This server is used to assist diskless  Erlang  nodes  which
     fetch all Erlang code from another machine.

     This server is used to fetch all code, including  the  start
     script,  if  an  Erlang  runtime  system is started with the
     -_l_o_a_d_e_r _i_n_e_t command line flag. All hosts specified with the
     -_h_o_s_t_s  _H_o_s_t flag must have one instance of this server run-
     ning.

     This server can be started  with  the  _k_e_r_n_e_l  configuration
     parameter _s_t_a_r_t__b_o_o_t__s_e_r_v_e_r.


EXPORTS
     start(Slaves) -> {ok, Pid} | {error, What}

          Types
               Slaves = [Host]
               Host = atom()
               Pid = pid()
               What = void()

          Starts  the  boot  server.  _S_l_a_v_e_s  is  a  list  of  IP
          addresses  for  hosts  which  are  allowed  to use this
          server as a boot server.

     start_link(Slaves) -> {ok, Pid} | {error, What}

          Types
               Slaves = [Host]
               Host = atom()
               Pid = pid()
               What = void()

          Starts the boot server and links to  the  caller.  This
          function  is used to start the server if it is included
          in a supervision tree.

     add_slave(Slave) -> ok | {error, What}

          Types
               Slave = Host
               Host = atom()
               What = void()

          Adds a _S_l_a_v_e node to the list of allowed slave hosts.

     delete_slave(Slave) -> ok | {error, What}

          Deletes a _S_l_a_v_e node from the  list  of  allowed  slave
          hosts.

          Types
               Slaves = [Host]
               Host = atom()

          Returns the current list of allowed slave hosts.
