MODULE
     log_mf_h - An Event Handler which Logs Events to Disk

DESCRIPTION
     The _l_o_g__m_f__h is a _g_e_n__e_v_e_n_t  handler  module  which  can  be
     installed  in  any  _g_e_n__e_v_e_n_t process. It logs onto disk all
     events which are sent to an event  manager.  Each  event  is
     written  as a binary which makes the logging very fast. How-
     ever, a tool such as the _R_e_p_o_r_t _B_r_o_w_s_e_r (_r_b) must be used in
     order  to read the files. The events are written to multiple
     files. When all files have been used, the first one  is  re-
     used  and overwritten. The directory location, the number of
     files, and the size  of  each  file  are  configurable.  The
     directory  will  include  one  file called _i_n_d_e_x, and report
     files _1, _2, .....

     init(Dir, MaxBytes, MaxFiles)

          Types
               Dir = string()
               MaxBytes = integer()
               MaxFiles = 0 < integer() < 256
               Pred = fun(Event) -> boolean()
               Event = term()
               Args = args()

          Initiates the  event  handler.  This  function  returns
          _A_r_g_s,   which   should   be   used   in   a   call   to
          _g_e_n__e_v_e_n_t:_a_d_d__h_a_n_d_l_e_r(_E_v_e_n_t_M_g_r, _l_o_g__m_f__h, _A_r_g_s).

          _D_i_r specifies which directory to use for the log files.
          _M_a_x_B_y_t_e_s  specifies  the  size of each individual file.
          _M_a_x_F_i_l_e_s specifies how many files are used. _P_r_e_d  is  a
          predicate  function  used  to  filter the events. If no
          predicate function is specified, all events are logged.
