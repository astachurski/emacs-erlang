MODULE
     CosEventChannelAdmin_SupplierAdmin -  This module implements
     a SupplierAdmin interface, which allows suppliers to be con-
     nected to the event channel.

DESCRIPTION
     The SupplierAdmin interface defines the first step for  con-
     necting suppliers to the event channel. It acts as a factory
     for creating proxy consumers. Both  consumer  administration
     and  supplier administration are defined as separate objects
     so that the creator of the channel can control the  addition
     of suppliers and consumers.

     Any object that possesses an object reference that  supports
     the  EventChannelFactory interface can perform the following
     operations:


EXPORTS
     obtain_push_consumer(Object) -> Return

          Types
               Object = #objref
               Return = #objref

          This  operation  returns  a  ProxyPushConsumer   object
          reference.

     obtain_pull_consumer(Object) -> Return

          Types
               Object = #objref
               Return = #objref

          This  operation  returns  a  ProxyPullConsumer   object
          reference.
