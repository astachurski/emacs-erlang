MODULE
     log_snmp - Implements an SNMP interface to the  log  service
     in the EVA application

DESCRIPTION
     This module implements an SNMP interface to the log  service
     in  the EVA application. The MIB implemented by this adapta-
     tion is OTP-LOG-MIB. The MIB is  located  in  the  directory
     _m_i_b_s in the distribution.


EXPORTS
     create_tables(Nodes) -> void()

          Types
               Nodes = [node()]

          This function creates the Mnesia tables required by the
          log SNMP implementation. _N_o_d_e_s is a list of nodes where
          the tables should be replicated.  This  list  of  nodes
          should specify the same nodes where the application EVA
          can be run distributed, in order for the log server  to
          always have local access to the tables.

          This function should be called once when installing the
          EVA application in the system.

     register_type(Type,TypeOid,TypeFunc)

          Types
               Type = term()
               TypeOid = oid() = [int()]
               TypeFunc = {M, F, A}
               M = F = atom()
               A = list()

          This function is used to register a type of log to  the
          SNMP  log  functionality.  The  _T_y_p_e is the same as the
          _T_y_p_e argument given to _l_o_g:_o_p_e_n/_3.

          The purpose of this function is to tell  the  SNMP  LOG
          functions  that all logs of type _T_y_p_e have an SNMP type
          defined in some MIB  (_T_y_p_e_O_i_d,  defined  as  an  OBJECT
          IDENTITY), and that the _T_y_p_e_F_u_n_c should be used to con-
          trol creation and transfer of logs of this type.

          The type control function  (_T_y_p_e_F_u_n_c)  will  be  called
          when  a  manger tries to create or delete a log of type
          _T_y_p_e_O_i_d, or when he tries to transfer  a  log  of  this
          type. The purpose of this function is to check if crea-
          tion is possible, and to format  the  log  when  it  is
          transferred. The function should be defined as:

              | {SnmpErr, Col}:
            M:F(validate_creation, LogIndex, Cols | A) -
                > true | false
                Called when the manager tries to create a new log
                of type _T_y_p_e_O_i_d. It is supposed to check if it is
                possible to create a new log of this type. If  it
                is,  it should return _t_r_u_e. If it is never possi-
                ble to create logs of this type, it should return
                _f_a_l_s_e.  Otherwise,  the  creation is not possible
                becasue some resource is not available,  and  the
                function  should  return  {_S_n_m_p_E_r_r_o_r,  _C_o_l}  (see
                definition of SNMP instrumenetation functions for
                a description of this).

            M:F(create, Log | A) -> ok | error:
                Called when _M:_F(_v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e__c_r_e_a_t_i_o_n, ...)  returned
                _t_r_u_e.  This  function  is  supposed to create the
                log. _L_o_g is a #_l_o_g record, defined in _l_o_g._h_r_l.

            M:F(delete, Log | A) -> void():
                Called when a log previously created by a manager
                is deleted.

            M:F(search, LogIndex, LogTrIndex | A) -> SearchFunc:
                Called when the manager activates a log  transfer
                for a log of this type. The _L_o_g_I_n_d_e_x is the index
                into _l_o_g_T_a_b_l_e, and {_L_o_g_I_n_d_e_x, _L_o_g_T_r_I_n_d_e_x} is  the
                index into the _l_o_g_T_r_a_n_s_f_e_r_T_a_b_l_e. This function is
                supposed to return a search function as specified
                in  _l_o_g:_t_r_a_n_s_f_e_r/_5.  The records for these tables
                are defined in _i_n_c_l_u_d_e/_l_o_g__s_n_m_p._h_r_l.

     start_link() -> {ok, Pid} | {error, Reason}

          Starts the LOG SNMP implementation. This  function  can
          be  used  to  include the service in a supervisor. Nor-
          mally, functions in the supervisor _l_o_g__s_u_p can be  used
          instead.

          The function  _c_r_e_a_t_e__t_a_b_l_e_s/_1  must  have  been  called
          before the server is started.

Instrumentation functions for the OTP-LOG-MIB
     In some cases other adaptations may need access to the  SNMP
     specific  data in LOG. To do this, the instrumentation func-
     tions for the SNMP objects can be used.  These  instrumenta-
     tion  functions  takes  the  arguments and return the values
     defined in the application _s_n_m_p.

log_snmp(3)         ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION          log_snmp(3)



          Instrumentation function for  _l_o_g_T_a_b_l_e.  This  function
          assumes  that  access  checks are made according to the
          MIB, so it may crash if e.g. _l_o_g_O_p_e_r_S_t_a_t_u_s is set.

     log_tr_table(Op, RowIndex, Cols) -> InstrumRet

          Instrumentation  function  for  _l_o_g_T_r_a_n_s_f_e_r_T_a_b_l_e.  This
          function  assumes that access checks are made according
          to the MIB.
