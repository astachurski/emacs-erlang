MODULE
     cosTime -  The main module of the cosTime application

DESCRIPTION
     To get access to the record definitions for  the  structures
     use:
      -_i_n_c_l_u_d_e__l_i_b("_c_o_s_T_i_m_e/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e/*._h_r_l").

     This module contains the functions for starting and stopping
     the application.

     This application use the time base _1_5  _o_c_t_o_b_e_r  _1_5_8_2  _0_0:_0_0.
     Performing  operations using other time bases will not yield
     correct result.

     The  OMG  CosTime  specification   defines   the   operation
     _s_e_c_u_r_e__u_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l__t_i_m_e.  As  of  today we cannot provide this
     functionality considering the criteria demanded  to  fulfill
     the OMG specification.

     When using this application, time and inaccuracy supplied by
     the  user  must  be given in number of _1_0_0 _n_a_n_o _s_e_c_o_n_d_s. The
     _T_i_m_e _D_i_s_p_l_a_c_e_m_e_n_t _F_a_c_t_o_r is positive east of  the  meridian,
     while those to the west are negative.

     This application use _c_a_l_e_n_d_e_r:_n_o_w__t_o__u_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l__t_i_m_e(_N_o_w)  to
     create  a  UTC.  Hence,  the  underlying  OS  must deliver a
     correct result when calling _e_r_l_a_n_g:_n_o_w().

     When determining the inaccuracy  of  the  system,  the  user
     should  consider the way the time objects will be used. Com-
     municating with other ORB's, add a substantial overhead  and
     should be taken into consideration.


EXPORTS

               Return = ok | {'EXIT', Reason}

          This operation installs the cosTime Time  Service  part
          application.

     uninstall_time() -> Return

          Types

     install_timerevent() -> Return

          Types
               Return = ok | {'EXIT', Reason}

          This operation installs the cosTime Timer Event Service
          part application.

  Note:
     The Timer Event Service part requires _T_i_m_e _S_e_r_v_i_c_e part  and
     _c_o_s_E_v_e_n_t  or the _c_o_s_N_o_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n application to be installed
     first.


     uninstall_timerevent() -> Return

          Types
               Return = ok | {'EXIT', Reason}

          This operation uninstalls the cosTime Timer Event  Ser-
          vice part application.

     start() -> Return

          Types
               Return = ok | {error, Reason}

          This operation starts the cosTime application.

     stop() -> Return

          Types
               Return = ok | {error, Reason}

          This operation stops the cosTime application.

     start_time_service(Tdf, Inaccuracy) -> Return

          Types
               Tdf = short()
               Inaccuracy = ulonglong(), eq. #100 nano seconds
               Return = ok | {'EXCEPTION', #'BAD_PARAM'{}}

          This operation starts a  Time  Service  server.  Please
          note  that  there  may only be exactly one Time Service
          active at a time. The _I_n_a_c_c_u_r_a_c_y parameter defines  the
          inaccuracy  the  underlying OS will introduce. Remember
          to take into account latency when passing  time  object
          between nodes.

     stop_time_service(TimeService) -> ok

cosTime(3)          ERLANG MODULE DEFINITION           cosTime(3)



          Types
               TimeService = #objref

          This operation stops the Time Service object.

     start_timerevent_service(TimeService) -> ok

          Types
               TimeService = #objref

          This operation starts a  Timer  Event  Service  server.
          Please  note  that  there may only be exactly one Timer
          Event Service per node active at a time.  The  supplied
          TimeServcie  reference  will  be the object Timer Event
          Service contacts to get access to a new UTC.

     stop_timerevent_service(TimerEventService) -> ok

          Types
               TimerEventService = #objref

          This operation stops the Timer Event Service object.
