MODULE
     net_adm - Various Erlang Net Administration Routines

DESCRIPTION
     This module contains various network utility functions.


EXPORTS
     host_file()

          This function reads the ._h_o_s_t_s._e_r_l_a_n_g file. It  returns
          the hosts in this file as a list, or it returns {_e_r_r_o_r,
          _R_e_a_s_o_n} if the file cannot be found.

     dns_hostname(Host)

          This function calls epmd for the fully  qualified  name
          (DNS)  of  _H_o_s_t.  It  returns {_o_k, _L_o_n_g_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e} if the
          call is successful, or {_e_r_r_o_r, _H_o_s_t} if _H_o_s_t cannot  be
          located by DNS.

     localhost()

          This function returns the fully qualified name  of  the
          local host, if it can be found by DNS.

     names(), names(Host)

          This function returns {_o_k, _L_i_s_t}  or  {_e_r_r_o_r,  _R_e_a_s_o_n}.
          _L_i_s_t  is a list of tuples on the form {_N_a_m_e, _P_o_r_t}. For
          example: _n_e_t__a_d_m:_n_a_m_e_s(_e_l_r_o_n_d) -> {_o_k, [{"_f_o_o", _6_1_1_7_8},
          {"_t_s", _6_1_1_6_0}]}.

     ping(Node)

          This function tries to set up a connection to _N_o_d_e.  It
          returns _p_a_n_g if it fails, and _p_o_n_g if it is successful.

     world (), world (verbose)

          This function runs _e_p_m_d - _n_a_m_e_s on all hosts which  are
          specified  in  the Erlang host file ._h_o_s_t_s._e_r_l_a_n_g, col-
          lects the replies and then evaluates _p_i_n_g on all  those
          nodes.  Accordingly,  connections  are  created  to all
          nodes which are running on the hosts specified  in  the
          ._h_o_s_t_s._e_r_l_a_n_g  file.  An  error  message  is printed if
          another user node is found when this is done.

          This function can be useful when a node is started, but
          the  names  of  the  other nodes in the network are not
          initially known.

     world_list (Hostlist), world_list (Hostlist, verbose)

          These functions are the same as  _w_o_r_l_d/_0  and  _w_o_r_l_d/_1,
          but  instead of reading the hostfile from ._h_o_s_t_s._e_r_l_a_n_g
          the hosts are specified in _H_o_s_t_l_i_s_t.

Files
     The ._h_o_s_t_s._e_r_l_a_n_g file consists of a number  of  host  names
     written  as  Erlang  terms. It can be located in the current
     work        directory,        $_H_O_M_E/._h_o_s_t_s._e_r_l_a_n_g,        or
     _c_o_d_e:_r_o_o_t__d_i_r()/._h_o_s_t_s._e_r_l_a_n_g.    The    format    of    the
     ._h_o_s_t_s._e_r_l_a_n_g file must be one host name per line. The  host
     names  must be within quotes as shown in the following exam-
     ples:

           'super.eua.ericsson.se'.
           'renat.eua.ericsson.se'.
           'grouse.eua.ericsson.se'.
           'gauffin1.eua.ericsson.se'.
           ^ (new line)
