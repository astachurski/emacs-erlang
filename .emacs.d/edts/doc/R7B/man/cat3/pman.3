MODULE
     pman - A graphical interface for inspecting  running  Erlang
     processes.

DESCRIPTION
     The process manager Pman is a tool that provides functional-
     ity  for  inspecting  the  state  of running processes in an
     Erlang runtime system.

     The user interface provides two main views:

       * a node overview showing all  running  processes  on  the
         selected node

       * a process trace window for following  the  execution  of
         one or more selected processes.

     Pman operates either locally or in a distributed Erlang sys-
     tem.

     Refer to the Pman User's Guide for a detailed description of
     the functionality.


EXPORTS
     start() -> Pid
     start(LIModuleExcluded) -> Pid

          Types
               Pid = pid()
               LIModuleExcluded = [atom()]

          _s_t_a_r_t/_0 starts the  process  manager  with  the  user`s
          saved settings, if there are any.

           _s_t_a_r_t/_1 also starts  the  process  manager,  with  the
          difference  that it will not show any processes execut-
          ing code in any of the modules  listed  in  _L_I_M_o_d_u_l_e_E_x_-
          _c_l_u_d_e_d

           _s_t_a_r_t/_0 and _s_t_a_r_t/_1 return the Pid of Pmans main  win-
          dow process if the start-up succeeds within 20 seconds,
          otherwise  it  will   fail   with   the   EXIT   reason
          {_s_t_a_r_t_u_p__t_i_m_e_o_u_t, _p_m_a_n}.

     start_notimeout() -> Pid
     start_notimeout(LIModuleExcluded) -> Pid

          Types
               Pid = pid()
               LIModuleExcluded = [atom()]

          _s_t_a_r_t__n_o_t_i_m_e_o_u_t/_0 starts the process manager  with  the
          user's saved settings, if there are any.

          _s_t_a_r_t__n_o_t_i_m_e_o_u_t/_1 also starts the process manager, with
          the difference that it will not show any processes exe-
          cuting code in any of the modules listed in _L_I_M_o_d_u_l_e_E_x_-
          _c_l_u_d_e_d.

          _s_t_a_r_t__n_o_t_i_m_e_o_u_t/_0 and _s_t_a_r_t__n_o_t_i_m_e_o_u_t/_1 return the  Pid
          of Pmans main window process. It will hang indefinitely
          waiting for successful start-up.

     proc(Process) -> Pid
     proc(A,B,C) -> Pid

          Types
               Pid = pid()
               Process = pid() | atom()
               A, B, C = integer()

          _p_r_o_c/_1 and _p_r_o_c/_3 both open  a  trace  window  for  the
          specified  process.  They are convenience functions for
          bypassing the process overview window in the  graphical
          user   interface.   _P_r_o_c_e_s_s   can  either  be  an  atom
          representing a registered process, or a PID.

          _p_r_o_c/_3 is merely  a  convenience  function  that  takes
          three  integers  as  arguments,  representing the three
          parts of the PID. (To  avoid  having  to  use  the  BIF
          _l_i_s_t__t_o__p_i_d/_1).

          The functions return the PID of the process controlling
          the  trace  output  window.  If there is a problem they
          will fail with the EXIT reason _u_n_d_e_f_i_n_e_d.
