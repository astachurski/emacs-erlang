MODULE
     CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPullConsumer -  This module imple-
     ments  a ProxyPullConsumer interface which acts as a middle-
     man between pull supplier and the event channel.

DESCRIPTION
     The ProxyPullConsumer interface defines the second step  for
     connecting pull suppliers to the event channel. A proxy con-
     sumer is similar to a normal consumer, but includes an addi-
     tional  method for connecting a supplier to the proxy consu-
     mer.

     There are a number of exceptions that can be  returned  from
     functions in this interface.

       * AlreadyConnected         is          defined          as
         -_r_e_c_o_r_d('_A_l_r_e_a_d_y_C_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d', {}).

       * CORBA    standard    BAD_PARAM     is     defined     as
         -_r_e_c_o_r_d('_B_A_D__P_A_R_A_M',           {'_O_E__I_D',          _m_i_n_o_r,
         _c_o_m_p_l_e_t_i_o_n__s_t_a_t_u_s}).

     The first exception is defined in the file _e_v_e_n_t__s_e_r_v_i_c_e._h_r_l
     and the second one in the file _c_o_r_b_a._h_r_l.

     Any object that possesses an object reference that  supports
     the  ProxyPullConsumer  interface  can perform the following
     operations:


EXPORTS
     connect_pull_supplier(Object, PullSupplier) -> Return

          Types
               Object = #objref
               PullSupplier = #objref of PullSupplier type
               Return = void

          This operation  connects  PullSupplier  object  to  the
          ProxyPullConsumer  object. If a nil object reference is
          passed CORBA standard _B_A_D__P_A_R_A_M exception is raised. If
          the   ProxyPullConsumer   is  already  connected  to  a
          PullSupplier, then the  _A_l_r_e_a_d_y_C_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d  _e_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n  is
          raised.

     disconnect_pull_consumer(Object) -> Return

          Types
               Object = #objref
               Return = void

          This operation disconnects proxy pull consumer from the
          event  channel  and sends a notification about the loss
          of the connection to the pull supplier attached to it.
