MODULE
     CosEventChannelAdmin_EventChannel -  This module  implements
     an Event Channel interface, which plays the role of a media-
     tor between consumers and suppliers.

DESCRIPTION
     An event channel is an object that allows multiple suppliers
     to  communicate  with  multiple consumers in a highly decou-
     pled, asynchronous manner. The event  channel  is  built  up
     incrementally.  An  event  channel factory could be used for
     creating an event channel. This factory could  be  found  in
     OrberEventChannel_EventChannelFactory  module. When an event
     channel is created no suppliers or consumers  are  connected
     to  it.  Event  Channel can implement group communication by
     serving as a replicator, broadcaster,  or  multicaster  that
     forward events from one or more suppliers to multiple consu-
     mers.

     It is up to the user to decide  when  an  event  channel  is
     created   and  how  references  to  the  event  channel  are
     obtained. By representing the event channel as an object, it
     has  all of the properties that apply to objects. One way to
     manage an event channel is to register it in a  naming  con-
     text, or export it through an operation on an object.

     Any object that possesses an object reference that  supports
     the  ProxyPullConsumer  interface  can perform the following
     operations:


EXPORTS
     for_consumers(Object) -> Return

          Types
               Object = #objref
               Return = #objref

          This operation returns a  ConsumerAdmin  object  refer-
          ence. If ConsumerAdmin object does not exist already it
          creates one.

     for_suppliers(Object) -> Return

          Types
               Object = #objref
               Return = #objref

          This operation returns a  SupplierAdmin  object  refer-
          ence. If SupplierAdmin object does not exist already it
          creates one.
