MODULE
     tv -  The Table  Visualizer  graphically  examines  ETS  and
     Mnesia tables.

DESCRIPTION
     The Table Visualizer enables the user  to  examine  ETS  and
     Mnesia  tables.  Once a certain table has been opened in the
     tool, the content may be viewed at various levels of detail.
     The  content viewed may also be sorted, using any element as
     key. The table may be polled anytime;  either  regularly  at
     specified  intervals,  or manually. New and deleted objects,
     as well as those altered,  are  marked  with  characteristic
     colors.
