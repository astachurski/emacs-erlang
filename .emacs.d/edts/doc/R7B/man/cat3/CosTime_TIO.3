MODULE
     CosTime_TIO -

DESCRIPTION
     To get access to the record definitions for  the  structures
     use:
      -_i_n_c_l_u_d_e__l_i_b("_c_o_s_T_i_m_e/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e/*._h_r_l").


EXPORTS
     '_get_time_interval'(TIO) -> TimeInterval

          Types
               TIO = #objref
               TimeInterval  =  #'TimeBase_IntervalT{lower_bound,
               upper_bound}
               lower_bound = upper_bound = ulonglong

          This operation returns the interval associated with the
          target object.

     spans(TIO, UTO) -> Reply

          Types
               TIO = UTO = OtherTIO = #objref
               Reply = {OverlapType, OtherTIO}
               OverlapType  =  'OTContainer'  |  'OTContained'  |
               'OTOverlap' | 'OTNoOverlap'

          This operation returns a _O_v_e_r_l_a_p_T_y_p_e depending  on  how
          the  interval  in  the  target object and the timerange
          represented by the UTO object overlap. If the  Overlap-
          Type  is 'OTNoOverlap' the out parameter represents the
          gap between the two intervals. If OverlapType is one of
          the  others,  the  out parameter represents the overlap
          interval. The definitions of the OverlapType's are:

            * 'OTContainer' - target objects lower and upper lim-
              its are, respectively, less or equal to and greater
              or equal to given object's.

            * 'OTContained' - target objects lower and upper lim-
              its are, respectively, greater or equal to and less
              or equal to given object's.

            * 'OTOverlap' - target objects interval overlap given
              object's.

            * 'OTNoOverlap' -  target  objects  interval  do  not
              overlap given object's.

     overlaps(TIO, OtherTIO) -> Reply

          Types
               TIO = OtherTIO = AnotherTIO = #objref
               Reply = {OverlapType, AnotherTIO}
               OverlapType  =  'OTContainer'  |  'OTContained'  |
               'OTOverlap' | 'OTNoOverlap'

          This operation returns a _O_v_e_r_l_a_p_T_y_p_e depending  on  how
          the  interval  in  the  target object and the timerange
          represented   by   the   TIO   object   overlap.    The
          OverlapType's are described under spans/2.

     time(TIO) -> UTO

          Types
               TIO = UTO = #objref

          This operation returns a  UTO  in  which  the  interval
          equals  the time interval in the target object and time
          value is the midpoint of the interval.
