          Objects supporting this interface can  be  informed  by
          supplier  objects  about which type of events that will
          be delivered in the future. This operation accepts  two
          parameters  describing  new and old event types respec-
          tively. If any of the supplied event type names is syn-
          tactically incorrect an exception is raised.
